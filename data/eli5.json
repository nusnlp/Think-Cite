Python, Blackadder, Ab Fab, Mighty Boosh, etc.  There are obviously many euphemisms unique to (British) English vs American, and over the years i have (i think) figured most out.  The one area i can not seem to understand from context is education.  \"A levels\", \"0 levels\", \"6th form\", \"uni\" (yes, i know uni is university, but here university and college are interchangable).  Can a Brit help a Yank out?  Also, shilling, pence, pound, quid, etc. can you explain the monetary terminology? are they slang or is it more complicated than 100 pence to the pound?  And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?",
        "answer": "**Education:**\n\nProgression is measured in Years. Start in Year 1 and finish school in Year 13. I think these are the same as grades. \n\nThese are grouped in Key Stages (KS). Years 1 and 2 are KS1. Here you would go to an infant school.\n\nYears 3 to 6 are KS2. Here you would transfer to a junior or primary school. \n\nYears 7-9 are KS3. Here you would transfer to a secondary school. Secondary schools also teach years 10 and 11, and some or most have a sixth form for Years 12 and 13.\n\nYears 10 and 11 are when you do GCSEs. Most people do about 10 different subjects. The old name for GCSEs was \"O-levels\". Year 11 is also the end of compulsory education.  \n\nYears 12 and 13 are when you enter sixth form. In sixth form, you get your A levels. Most people do 3 A levels, and progress to university. University will likely have an entry requirement, say AAB, this means you need two A grades and a B grade in your subjects in A level.\n\nCollege here tends to refer to a vocational school, as an alternative to A levels after compulsory education. If you want to be a plumber or mechanic, then you would go to a college. \n\n\n**Money:**  \n\nShilling is old money. I have no idea how much a shilling is worth, and I've never seen one. My grandparents are probably familiar with them though.  \npound = dollar  \nquid = buck  \npence = cent  \n100 pence in a pound\n\n\n > And do Brits find the equivalent American systems as confusing?\n\nPersonally, yes. I don't really know what middle school and high school is. I didn't know that college and university meant the same thing, and \"valedictorian\" sounds like a fancy librarian.

        "answer": "I would attribute it to the ability to play well with others, as in the base for their products. Let me explain: Apple, for the most part, creates their own hardware and software for all their products. While they do allow apps from 3rd party companies, they limit the number of permissions to their iPhones and iPads in order to keep them a \"closed\" system, and since Siri is a part of that software package, developers don't get to have as much cooperation with Siri as the Google Assistant, Alexa, or even Cortana. Also, if you look at the companies that design these assistants, they all admittedly have different goals and methods of getting to those goals. Siri was created as a voice assistant for iOS and related products, and that's it. Google Assistant was created by a company that also has the most popular search engine in the world AND created an open source OS for mobile phones and tablets, thus opening up the uses for Google Assistant and its knowledge pool. Alexa was created by the world's largest online retailer, which dabbles in devices that run on the same open source OS as a standard Android phone, plus they have developed a partnership with Microsoft that allows them to allow Cortana and Alexa to talk to each other, meaning that they have a link to one of the world's largest software companies and their knowledge base on making a voice assistant.\n\nTL;DR: Siri is not as advanced as Alexa, Google, or even Cortana due to Apple's tendency to keep everything in house, as opposed to the partnerships and knowledge bases created by Google (Alphabet, if you're being technical), Microsoft and Amazon.",

        "answer": "Basically, the things involved are so small that the drag on them from trying to move in the cellular fluid is far far larger than the acceleration forces trying to move them around. \n\nIn simplistic terms, as you get smaller liquids \"feel thicker\". At the cellular level it's like us trying to move in molasses. The cell bits are very well cushioned by the fluid around them. \n\nIn fluid dynamics terms, the ratio of acceleration (inertial) to gooiness (viscous) forces is called Reynolds number. The Reynolds number at cell sizes with water-based fluid is really really small, which means acceleration forces have very little effect.",

From what I gather, he is saying that \"no one knows\" how a helicopter can have that much lift to lift a helicopter.\n\nIs he full of shit?  Can you explain to me, AND the lift... all the numbers/proof you could give me I would appreciate it.",
        "answer": "Your friend should stop publicly evaluating the merit of confirmed engineering practices until he can learn to open a book. Thousands of aerospace and aeronautical engineers aren't just guessing at the basic principles of lift here. I'm a fixed-wing pilot, so if any rotary guys are hanging out feel free to jump in and add/correct.\n\n\n\nA helicopter, or any wing, is more than capable of creating lift based on the shape and speed of the wing, or for a helicopter, rotors. Pilots call helicopters \"Rotary Wing\" aircraft because that is what they are. To understand the really massive amount of force pushing the helicopter's wings up, you need to think about the shape of that wing and the speed it is traveling at. \n\n*****\n\nIf you run a string along the top of a wing or rotor, that string will be longer than if you run it across the bottom of the wing. The air the wing is cutting through though is initially meeting the front of the wing at the same speed, whether it goes over the top or the bottom. Because the air has a longer path to travel over the top, it becomes less compacted, creating an area of lower relative pressure than the air passing beneath it. Imagine two lines of ants walking 5mph around a wing shaped divider. The ones walking in the straight line get to the other side faster than the ones walking around the curved side. This pressure differential generates, at high speed, what we call \"lift\" and pushes the helicopter into the sky. \n\n\n\nFrom there it is just math to make the jump from a little push to a big push, especially once you get to the high speeds a helicopter's engine pushes those rotors up to. If you consider that when you spin a wheel, a point on the outside is travelling a farther distance (circumference) in the same amount of time (1 revolution) as a point on the inside of the wheel, you see how the speed of the air passing over the wing gets very very large as you move out to the ends of the rotors. \n\n\n\nWith that kind of lift force, it is easy to see how the main rotor provides both the force to go up, as well as the force to go forward when the rotor is angled forward. \n\n*****\n\nI understand that this is perhaps not as simple as it should be for an ELI5, but I hope it at least helps you refute your friend. The best simple response to him is that a helicopter is not magic, it simply has two very fast wings travelling in rotation, as opposed to straight, hence its ability to force itself straight up into the sky.",

They like me and all, but such a sudden demand to be near me and such outward showings of affection has never happened before.\n\nWhile that's all fine and dandy, yay for sweet baby animals, I suppose my question is more specifically this: **how would five-week-old kittens understand human distress enough to immediately go to them/comfort them?** At that young and with their life experience, they couldn't have possibly experienced a human crying before, or possibly understand why. \n\nWhat's the science behind this stuff?\n\nEdit: Aaaaand, like a doofus, didn't tag the title.",

        "answer": "You're misinterpreting the meaning of his principle. It's not a theory per se, it's a set of inequalities that assert limits to the precision by which pairs of complimentary variables of a particle can be known. This is not to be confused with the observer effect, which states that measuring a system affects it. In fact, Heisenberg's uncertainty explains the observer effect. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental property of quantum systems, and thus our physics are founded on it.\n\nSo in that capacity, yes, we observe it all the time when working in quantum systems. In fact, some quantum technologies are based upon it, including aspects of quantum computers, super conductors, quantum optics, and gravitational wave interferometers.\n\nLastly, never say \"just a theory\" again, it trivializes the underpinnings of all science. Newton rolls in his grave and spontaneously combusts in protest. Theories are not hypothesis, they are not educated guesses, they are not unfounded - theories explain facts and their relations, and are thus a higher order of knowledge than facts.

        "answer": "I'm sure there's a *ton* of things wrong with it, as there is with most large industries, but I'll start this one off by exploring a little about the way music gets created. \n\n\nSo, you work for the music industry and your job is to make money. That's it. Say you're looking for bands to sign, which will lead to their music being mass produced and shoved down throats far and wide. Ok, so say you go to a couple of concerts by some local bands and at the first concert you find the band to be incredible. They're obviously skilled musicians, incentive songwriting, just really good unique stuff, BUT, there's not many people in the crowd. Maybe they'd just starting out or they don't promote on social media or something. The second band you go to see is much worse. They aren't very skilled, and half the song is prerecorded and being played through the PA system. You don't enjoy this band, BUT, the place is packed and they obviously have a lot of friends and a social media presence. Now, since your job is to make money, you're going to sign the band that sells the most tickets. They're the most popular and thus will be a better investment financially. Now I'm on the other side of the country and don't really have a way to listen to either of these bands until one gets signed and their music gets mass produced and they go on tour. So the band that I get to hear is the one that was the most profitable. The music had nothing to do with it from your perspective. Does that sound good for me or other listeners out there?\n\n\n\nAlso, in pop music, many of the artists are manufactured products. They're basically a mascot that dances around while the music plays. There's some good singers out there, but they're not typically the ones writing, recording, and playing the music. There's tons of people involved in the creation of a single track, from recording engineers, multiple songwriters, producers, and studio music and whose names you'll never hear. No, apparently we want someone physically attractive that can dance to help us enjoy the music more. But why is this bad if people enjoy it? Well, for kind of the same reason as the other thing: it keeps us from hearing other stuff that was created through passion for playing and songwriting. The production company wants to make money. They aren't interested in highlighting talent and showcasing new acts. So again, it becomes more difficult to find new stuff that you might like because everything is saturated with the soup of the day. You know how some people often say \"music sucks nowadays...\"? Well, there's plenty of great new stuff out there, it's just being buried by the piles and piles of profitable stuff. Think of it like a popular Reddit thread. If you came late but made an awesome, funny comment, it's never going to see the light of day because it'll be buried in other comments. There's probably the best music you've ever heard being played in someones garage or bedroom, but how will it ever get to us?\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'm sure there's plenty of other, more specific examples, but these are just some general thoughts I had.",

OP is asking about *states* not the federal government.  49 states have a bicameral legislature.   The main differences between the two houses are usually slight.  Usually the members in the upper house will have longer terms between elections and bigger districts, and few other differences.   So the main benefit comes from the mere *fact* that laws have to pass through two different bodies of people, who don't owe each other a damn thing.   It's not uncommon in legislative bodies from time to time to have a powerful party leader or committee chairman who is crazy, corrupt and/or stupid and gets crazy stuff passed through their house without argument.  But having to do the whole thing over again with a completely different set of people makes it more likely that the craziest stuff will simply not pass a second time.

It's always possible that there will come a new interpretation of the science that makes more sense, but this has been going on in quantum for about 100 years. Don't jump straight to \"WE CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE\". For many of these situations just because something seems to provide information faster than light it doesn't mean that an observer can get useful info out of it. Let's say that the photon \"knows the future\" a few nanoseconds ahead. Ok, but how long would it take for you to call someone on the other end of the experiment and tell them what you know? Even if you are as fast as the speed of light, you can't beat that other photon as it has a head start... So by the time you dial the other room and say \"THE GATE IS CLOSED\", it's already happened, you're not providing new info.

In the relatively short period of time since cats have been 'domesticated', they have changed relatively little (apart from size) and are still quasi-feral (hence why domesticated is in quotations), as in they can survive in the wild if they didn't live with humans.\n\nAs such, cats typically view other cats as competition, and will attempt to assert their dominance as the alpha in their relationship. It's the same reason why when you first get a dog, it's belligerent and quite hard to control. Now of course, there are always exceptions to the rule, as is the case with siblings, and no feline relationship is going to be the same.\n\nBasically, I'd say that the reason why your cats can't get along is because the female cat is resentful that the male cat is higher up the social chain than she is",

The vast majority of First Nations who live on reserves were born on that reserve or one like it. Their friends, family, and co-workers are all there, and that reserve signifies a sense of cultural 'place'.\n\nMainstream Canadians have that sense of place too, but their impetus for residing in a place has more to do with the inherent economic opportunity than the cultural context. This is why places like Fort McMurray have strong population growth despite not a lot of people thinking it would be an otherwise highly desirable place to live.\n\nThis difference is was initially caused by and is presently being encouraged by the political ramifications of First Nations reserves with respect to the Indian Act. Reserves are not incorporated like mainstream Canadian municipalities, and their justification is primarily political as opposed to economic. This may not be the only, but certainly is a major factor in ensuring that First Nations stay on reserves and do not fully integrate into mainstream Canadian society like other minorities or immigrants.",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "People here seem to confuse virtual memory with using swap, swapping pages to harddisk. \n\nVirtual memory is used to hide fragmentation of memory to a program. The best way to explain this is through the idea of multiple programs using the same computer. When a program is created it is easier to pretend it has one big chunk of memory in one continuous piece, as opposed to having to deal with memory fragments on various locations. Since a program, like a video game, can use a large amount of memory it is very hard to give each program a large continuous block of physical memory without running out of memory. To hide this virtual memory is used, which hides the fragmentation from the program. Basically the program is tricked into thinking it has memory in one continuous block, whereas in fact in may be spread out over RAM, or even placed on disk (swapped to disk) or *not even physically represented* when it is not used.\n\nAdded to this often address space (the entire amount of addressable memory) separation is used. Every program is tricked into having a huge (2-3GB on 32 bit programs, ~2^64 bytes of memory in 64 bit programs) address space, which often can't even be stored on physical memory or hard disks. The program isn't even aware of other programs using memory, only a (sometimes small, sometimes large) amount for the operating system is reserved. Since only active portions of memory are mapped to physical memory  this means it is possible for this system to work. There are some issues with this approach, but thats beyond ELI5 (if this wasn't already).\n\nIn **ELI5** (maybe a bit more like 10 years old, but okay) terms you could compare it to money on a bank account. The money you see on the account is what is virtual and you only ever use a portion of it. You also can't access other peoples' accounts. Now, when everyone decides to take their money from the bank the bank will be in trouble: it is running out of available money. \nNow imagine instead of everyone having a variable amount of money, everyone has the same enormous amount of money available on their account. If one person decides to take all of his money from the bank, then it will also be in trouble because the amount of money they 'virtually' have is so large. This is basically what happens with virtual memory and address separation, every person (program) has a large amount of virtual money (memory) available on their own account, but the actual amount of physical money the bank (computer) has is limited. Fortunately, most programs are well behaved and don't actually spend money (use memory) when they dont have to.\n\nI do realize the money analogy doesn't really explain the mapping of memory from virtual to physical and avoidance of fragmentation, but this was the only example I could think of unfortunately.",

The locations of the tracks on the disk are at fixed positions, and so this lets the motor move the head over each track by snapping forward or backwards X clicks.  The sound drivers for those types of videos just cycle the motors on to make sounds.  Since it moves it fixed intervals, and you can pick the frequency of turning the motor on you can emulate a small range of notes.  Then it becomes a matter of playing each note in parallel, so you end up with several drives needed for the video as each one is tasked with playing only a subset of the notes.\n\nIt's very similar to these: _URL_0_ where the lighting arcs are either on or off, so by pulsing the lighting at any given frequency you can create that note in the air.",

        "question": "How does the internet work? (actual explonation?)",
        "question_ctx": "So I've been wondering, how does the transfer of information happen between two machines connected to the internet.\n\n1. How does the information gets deconstructed to electricity (or light perhaps?) from one machine\n2. How it travels through the fiber (electrons bumping into each other?)\n3. how does the line tell what information goes where. (considering that a lot of people use the same cable for this transfer.)\n\nThank you guys ",
        "answer": "The things you ask about in questions 1  &  2 aren't \"the internet\", they are the links that connect networks together. There are many different kinds of link - Ethernet, fibre optic, DSL, cable, and so on, and not all of them are part of the internet. That all carry \"packets\" of data from point to point. What's happening physically varies a lot, but \"the internet\" isn't defined by the links themselves, rather by the higher-level logic used to route traffic between networks. So I'm only going to try to answer Q3. \n\nRouting is the 1-word answer, and that's a whole subject of its own You can study it, take exams and gain certifications in it. It's Routing that makes the internet work at all - there would be no Internet without it. \n\nFor example: if you have a typical router in your home, that creates an internal network, and your devices (PCs, phones, printers, TVs etc.) join up to that. (The router provides the information the \"clients\" need to do so.) They can all talk to each other directly (e.g. PC to printer), and that's what makes them part of the same network. The servers that a website uses are on a different network in a different location, so to talk to e.g. Microsoft you need a way to go talk across networks. This is called \"routing\", and it starts with your home router. It recognises that you have asked for something on the internet, and therefore routes that request \"outside\". That's all it knows: inside vs. outside. Your router doesn't know exactly where Reddit is, only that it's not in your house. The same logic is repeated every step of the way: at your ISP, at their \"backbone\" provider (s), each router on the internet only knows its part of the route to the destination.  \n\nFor example: a packet from my PC here in Dublin might get routed to the Level 3 backbone, on to the Yellow / AC-2 cable across the Atlantic to Brookhaven NY, where a router reads the destination address, and sends it back out on the link that it believes will get it to Microsoft in Seattle - probably via its headquarters in Broomfield CO. (Actually - since I'm in Ireland - if I access the Microsoft website, I'm actually talking to a server hosted by Akamai in Amsterdam.)",

I want to know details on types of contracts, what happens when the phone stops working, when the phone is lost and also I want to know whether people save or spend money when they enter into such contracts.",
        "answer": "Mobile phones service providers generally provide two different types of services, Pay As You Go and contracts.\n\nIn a contract phone, you literally sign a contract with the phone company. In exchange for a fixed monthly fee, they will provide you with a certain number of services relating to your mobile phone use. These services may vary a lot depending on the contract. This is different from Pay As You Go, where you only pay for what you use, and usually you have your own phone.\n\n**Time** A phone contract lasts for a fixed period of time, which can vary depending on how much you pay. Usually, you are not allowed to terminate the contract early or change it, or if you do you have to pay high penalties. Some contracts will renew automatically, others might change every time they expire.\n\n**Phone** Contracts usually include all or part of the cost of the phone. Some contracts may allow you to choose what phone you have depending on length and monthly payments, others might request an extra initial payment for more expensive models. The cost of buying a phone is usually much cheaper if you are in a contract. Some contracts may allow you to upgrade your phone during the contract, or give you an upgrade if you renew.\n\n**Use** Different contracts offer different amounts of usage - this is generally fixed. The amount you pay determines the amount of phone minutes, texts and data allowance you have. Going over this allowance may incur extra (usually expensive) payments. Some contracts allow you to change your allowances, others are more restrictive.\n\n**Perks** Contract phones usually have more perks than Pay As You Go phones, because the company is guaranteeing your custom for the duration of the contract. This may include discounts and offers, extra usage allowance after certain periods, free voicemail and other features, free calls to certain numbers, offers related to loyalty or how long you've had your contract, etc.\n\n**Insurance** Some contracts include phone insurance, some offer discounted insurance, and some don't offer any - it all depends on how much you pay and how long your contract is. Usually, if your contract does not include insurance and you lose or damage your phone, it is up to you to fix/replace it (but the company may offer you to do so at a cheaper price).\n\nThere are a myriad of phone companies and phone contracts tailored for loads of different lifestyles. The pros are that you don't have to worry about running out of credit, it's often cheaper to buy or upgrade your phone, data usage is often cheaper in a contract, you may get some great perks like free Wi-Fi hostposts and other things which save you money in the long run. The cons are that you are tied to a company for a period of time, you might be paying for stuff you aren't actually using, you might have to deal with a lot of corporate nonsense to ensure you get what you actually want.\n\nUsually (at least here in the UK) if you walk into a phone store and have a chat with a representative they can run you through the contracts they have available and recommend what works best for you based on your spending and phone using habits. Because of the many, many different contracts available and many, many different types of people who use mobile phones, it is very difficult to say whether a phone contract will save you money - it all really depends on how you use your phone versus how much and what you pay for.",

By narrowing the light to a pinhole, the lens and cornea don't have to focus anything - the light passes straight through (or it is curved, but it's all curved the same).

        "answer": "I explained this in [another thread about America's credit rating](_URL_0_) but I've copied and pasted it here:\n\nAlright, here we go.\n\nThe US faces deficit nearly every year. In order to pay for those deficits, it borrows from its citizens and foreigners. The way that they pay for this debt is through treasury bonds, which have a certain interest rate that the US must pay back after the allotted time has elapsed.\n\nThe US has a perfect credit rating because it has always paid its debts back in time. For this reason, US debt is the least risky and most secure debt in the world. (To tell you the truth, I believe it is the least risky investment in the entire world, though I may be mistaken.) This gives the US incredible power. The US can borrow huge amounts of debt because its debt is so valuable compared to other investments.\n\nSo let's say the US defaults. The credit rating is dropped. This means that US debt is no longer safe - or nearly as safe. Because US debt is now risky, the US can no longer borrow at its previously low rates. All interest rates rise very quickly. The US will still be able to borrow in the future, but at a much, much higher cost.\n\nSo how does this affect you? Well, US debt will be more expensive. So any interest rates that the US has its hands in - college loans, etc. - will increase. Not only that, but this interest rate spike will carry over to the funds market in the domestic US, meaning that mortgages, loans, interest rates for cars, etc. spike quickly.\n\nIf it spikes enough, economic forecasts will look very dim. Americans will start to predict a bad outlook for our country. When Americans begin to doubt the economy, recessions happen. This is because Americans are less likely to spend when they are uncertain about the future and GDP decreases.\n\nNo one is quite sure how this will affect everyone. It will turn into a recession - most economists do not argue over that. But will it become a depression? Probably not, though it's possible. The US has rarely had to deal with such events, so it's hard to predict.\n\nAlso, to add to the above, government will have to decrease spending to ensure that defaults don't happen in the future. With less government spending, entitlement programs become less effective - many will not get their social security checks, medicaid, etc. This alone could trigger the recession, or make the recession worse.\n\nWow, that was a lot.

        "answer": "It's interesting when you look at dust in the full scale that it really is: dust is everywhere. Literally. The bits that ultimately make up dust are so tiny, it's like salt in the ocean; you're breathing it in right now as you read this. Don't worry though, it's harmless (in normal conditions) and a main factor is dead skin anyway, so it's as bad as chewing your nails, if that at all.\n\nI say that last part for a point. The \"origin\" of dust is everywhere, but the consistently noticeable contributor is dead skin. And you're doing it right now. Right this second, hundreds of tiny tiny bits are floating off your arms and legs like daffodils. Don't believe me? Go in a room with some harsh light contrast (for us photographers, that's fancy talk for a room with a source of really strong light, like a window, but otherwise pretty unlit) and rub your arms a few times, watch the tiny little flakes float off. Your hair is even worse, regardless of dandruff, because it can get caught in the hairs, so if you ruffle your hair, boom, a mini-snowstorm.\n\nSo now we know where it comes from (everything) and where it's found (everywhere) but why don't we see it all over the place? And why do we see it layered on top of undisturbed things like an abandoned home or that space on the top of your TV? Well, both questions are answered by one word: wind. The dust is so tiny, it takes a lot of dust (and in dust terms, we're talking thousands of particles) to weigh it down to one place. The slightest breeze prevents this, so busy, open places with wind or high traffic are naturally void of any build up. Alternatively, when dust is given the time, those particles rub against each other, develop static cling, and clump. This is also why you see cobwebs that are so thick they sometimes drop to the floor.\n\n**TL;DR Dust is dust because we are slowly dying and do nothing to stop it.**",

        "answer": "So your TMJ (temporomandibular joint - the part of your jaw that connects to the rest of your head, just in front of your ear) is a super interesting joint. [Check out this image] (_URL_0_). Notice how, when the jaw is open, part of it is actually disarticulated from its socket. You can actually feel this if you open your jaw very wide with your fingers pressed against the area just in front of your ears; the condylar process of the mandible gets pulled out of the joint space by the lateral pterygoid muscle. \n\nWhat this basically translates into is that being hit in the jaw, especially from the side, while it is open, increases the risk of damage, since the joint capsule is \"exposed\". In other words - it's easier to dislocate a jaw that has already partially dislocated itself. A hit to the jaw from the front or from below is equally dangerous whether the jaw is open or closed and since the TMJ is just in front of the ear canal, you can do some serious damage to your auditory system that way too.",

        "question": "Why do some sites not allow you to have special characters in your password? Wouldn't it be better to always have as secure a password as possible?",
        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "There have been news stories about websites getting hacked, and the hackers making off with lots of customer/employee/third-party information.  How do hackers normally do this?\n\nIn the younger days of the internet, most sites were vulnerable to an exploit called SQL injection.  SQL is a programming language associated with a type of database.  A database is what actually stores information that website visitors put into the website so they can use the site how they want.  Most sites these days have a database they rely on to control--among other things--how users can access the site's services.  Other sites use flat files or databases stored in flat files, such as those created and managed by Microsoft Access, which come with their own problems, but we'll stick with actual databases here.  \n\nFor example, whenever you sign up to use the services of a website, the information you put into the account setup page is then stored in a database.  You are actually telling the web application what information to put into the database by inputting values into the page's input fields, then clicking the \"Submit\" button.  The page will ask you for things such as a username and password, maybe your name and birthdate, and whatever else the web site needs to build a profile of you.  Depending on the site, it may even ask a user for their credit card details and other financial information.  The web application updates the database by using an application account to log into the database, then either inserting new information into the database, or updating the information already in the database so it can be used later.  When you then log into the website later, you input your username and password you set up when you created your account, and the application attempts to retrieve the information from the database, checking to see if what you put in is the same as what is in the database, then it gives you access to the services available to your account.\n\nWhere it will sometimes go wrong is when the web application is told to get data from the database that the application is not supposed to return to a normal user.  This is accomplished by knowing what the application expects the user to put into a certain input field, knowing how the application's queries to the database are written, and knowing that either the application administrator or the database administrator did not limit the web application's access to the database--giving the application access to everything in the database, instead of limiting the application for just the tables and permissions it needs.\n\nHere is a simplistic example.  A user wants to log into a web site.  The user puts in the username and password for his or her account.  The web application usually then logs into the database and performs a query--SELECT \\* FROM users where username=user1 and password=password2.  If a valid row is returned, the user gets logged into the site, is given the permissions the account is set up with, and continues the session.  If no data is returned, the user is deposited on the \"Wrong password\" page.  Seems logical, right?\n\nNow, say a hacker logs into the same website, but he or she does not put in a valid username--the hacker simply puts in an asterisk in the username and password fields.  Depending on how the application is written, it may log into the database and perform this query instead--SELECT \\* FROM users where username=\\* and password=\\*  (reddit may have a formatting problem with that).  Depending on how the application and database are set up, the hacker may get a database error, he or she may get logged into the first account set up in the web site (which often is the admin account), or the application may return a list of user accounts, complete with usernames and passwords (and maybe credit card numbers, expiration dates, etc).  You can see how this may be a problem.  There are other methods of tricking the application into giving up data, using a similar method of SQL injection, but the result is often the same--either someone has acquired more information than they need, or someone is just given the keys to the kingdom.\n\nTo combat this problem, some websites have written the database queries their applications use to get data from the database so that queries do not return so much data, which in some cases results in a tiny performance boost.  For example, a SELECT userid FROM users where username=\\* and password=* may simply return a list of userids instead of the entire users table--but some applications will allow the hacker to be logged into the first account in the database--the admin account, usually.  Also, most sites do not save account passwords to their databases in readable form--they run the passwords through an encryption algorithm before saving them as hashes in the database--instead of \"password2\", there may be a long string of random characters and numbers in its place.  So, a user logs into the database with \"password2\", the application immediately puts the user's input through the encryption, and if it matches the resulting hash in the database, the user is allowed access to the account.  However, in poorly-written applications, this still results in an unauthorized user logged into someone else's account.  In an effort to stop this, most sites today use code which scrubs most special characters out of input fields to guard against sql injection.  So, when a hacker goes to put asterisks in an input field, the hacker presses Submit, the application immediately scrubs the asterisks out, and the hacker is left with either a database error, or--on well-written applications--deposited on a Wrong Password page.  This is normally called \"sanitizing\" the input.  Most of the sites you will browse have this feature in the application, but some sites will not.  Best to not try and find out.\n\nSo, basically, you're not allowed to have special characters in the password field on some sites because the website owners don't want other people getting access to your information, so they run most of their inputs through a scrubber that stops what used to be a very prolific exploit.",

        "answer": "There are many [electric aircraft](_URL_0_) that have been designed and built over the years, yes. Some of them have been successful, from a technical point of view. But I don't believe any of them have been successful from a commercial point of view.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, Tesla have worked very hard to [make their car more aerodynamically efficient](_URL_1_). Aircraft design, however, has been focusing on aerodynamics for much longer than car design, and although modern materials have led to some improvements to aerodynamics in modern aircraft, there isn't a whole lot more that can be done.\n\nAnother problem is that batteries are heavy. Carrying extra weight in a car carries a penalty and uses more fuel - but carrying extra weight in an aircraft carries a much greater penalty than in a car.\n\nOnce you've overcome these technical problems, certification would be the next major hurdle. It takes an enormous amount of money, time and expertise to certify new technologies for use in aircraft. This is one of the reasons why, until recently, most light piston-engine aircraft were fitted with engines from the 1950s - the cost of certifying new engines simply wasn't justified by the technical advances that were made in the 60 years or so, until rising fuel costs have recently made it worth certifying diesel engines.\n\nBut it wouldn't surprise me if it happens one day, especially for light aircraft.",

If race is entirely socially constructed then how does the government get away with race-based financial aid? (affirmative action)\n\nIf race boils down to purely what one identifies as, then how is it deemed OK for the government to ask for your race in official forms? One would think that the ACLU or NAACP would challenge the government and abolish the notion of governmental distinctions based on race.  Why doesn't this happen?",
        "answer": "There are no sociological characteristics that correspond 1:1 with skin color, which is how \"race\" is determined in the United States. That is not to say that skin color is not a biological trait that is passed from generation to generation. Rather, it simply means that behavioral traits we associate with certain races are not genetically linked to the phenotypical traits we use to define those races.\n\nIt may be true that the genes that facilitate becoming a violin virtuoso are disproportionately found among people whose ancestors come from Asia. But these genes are not linked in any way to something like epicanthic folds. Also, genes for dark skin are dominant over genes for fair skin, but other, invisible genes from a white parent may be dominant  over those from a black parent. Thus, we see Barack Obama as the first black President because we key in on what we can see, but he's just as white as he is black. We call Tiger Woods a great black golfer, but investigate his racial heritage. I think he is actually 1/4 black. These are the kinds of things that sociologists mean when they say race is a social construction. \n\nMany sociology professors articulate this poorly, partly because it is a very abstract concept, and partly because they aren't in the business of explaining abstract concepts, but rather in political indoctrination. But I'm a sociologist and I don't want to indoctrinate anyone and I assure you that skin color is not a primary characteristic that geneticists use to identify haplogroups.\n\nNEVERTHELESS, lumping people together into a social group will cause them to behave in reaction to society as if they are a \"real\" group. Affirmative action is not an attempt to ameliorate problems caused by skin color. These policies are designed to ameliorate problems caused by people who think that skin color means something more than how far from the equator your ancestors were when they evolved.",

Vaginal lubrication is always present, but production increases significantly near ovulation and during sexual arousal in anticipation of sexual intercourse. Vaginal dryness is the condition in which this lubrication is insufficient, and sometimes artificial lubricants are used to augment it. Without sufficient lubrication, sexual intercourse can be painful to women. **The vaginal lining has no glands, and therefore the vagina must rely on other methods of lubrication. Plasma seepage from vaginal walls due to vascular engorgement is considered to be the chief lubrication source, and the Bartholin's glands, located slightly below and to the left and right of the introitus (vaginal opening), also secrete mucus to augment vaginal-wall secretions.** Near ovulation, cervical mucous provides additional lubrication.",

There are two easy ways to measure how well you did: you could tell your friend how long it took you to run the race, or you could tell him in what place you finished.\n\nUpon hearing how well you did, your so-called friend exclaims \"Ha! I did twice as well as you!\" If you had told him what place you took, this wouldn't make any sense: what is \"twice as well\" as third place, for example? On the other hand, \"twice as well\" as a four-minute-and-26-second race makes complete sense. If your friend ran in the same race as you and only took two minutes and 13 seconds, he could've taken either second or first place; all we really know as far as placement is that he did better than you.\n\nThat's the difference between an *ordinal* measurement (what place you took in the race) and a *cardinal* measurement (how long it took you to run the race). A measurement is cardinal if the \"distance\" between two measurements is consistent: the \"distance\" between two and three minutes is one minute, and the \"distance\" between three minutes and four minutes is one minute, and that always means the same thing. An ordinal measurement doesn't work the same way: the \"distance\" between third and second place isn't necessarily the same as the difference between second and first place.\n\nAn ordinal measurement gives you a ranking; it tells you which of two things is better.

        "answer": "A lot of people seem to be saying \"so they can target ads\" or \"so they get lots of information about you\", but that's not really the case. Let me explain a bit about how this works.\n\nWhen you click \"log in with Facebook\", the website sends you to a website controlled by Facebook (not them) that asks you to log in if you aren't already logged in, and then asks you to authorize their application to access certain information. If you click OK, then it sends a token to that website allowing them to access only the information that they requested access to.\n\nThat Facebook page will tell you what they are requesting access to. The list of things they can ask for is on [this page](_URL_0_), but most of these websites just ask for the basics- public_profile and maybe email, so they'll get your name, profile picture, and your email, but they won't have access to your likes or your friends list or anything like that. If they do want access to that other stuff, the page will tell you. You should always read this page to make sure that random websites aren't requesting permission to spam all your friends and like pages on your behalf. \n\nThe advantage of this to Facebook is that you have more stuff tied to your Facebook account so you become more tied to the Facebook ecosystem. They also know what app/website you're using, but they don't know enough about what you're using the app for to target any additional ads to you.\n\nFor the website, there are two main benefits.\n\nFirst of all, the sign-up flow is way easier- it's literally just two clicks if you're already signed in to Facebook. If they need a bunch of information from you, they'd otherwise need a much longer sign-up process, and a lot of people tend to give up if the sign-up process is too long. \n\nSecond, they get to take advantage of all of Facebook's security. Facebook has something like 17,000 employees. They have whole teams just dedicated to keeping your information safe. Joe's Forum does not have whole teams dedicated to keeping your information safe, so it's much more likely that Joe gets hacked than Facebook. That means Joe doesn't have to worry about stopping hackers from creating tons of fake accounts, and if his website does get hacked, the hackers won't get access to all of his user's personal information (since all of that is stored in Facebook).",

I also assume you're talking about leg and hoof injuries, which are the most common forms of injury that horses are put down for. \n\nHorses are quite large and weigh quite a bit and their legs support much more weight than human legs. When they break, they tend to shatter completely, so much so that they lacerate a ton of tissue around the injury and so completely that it is almost impossible to put the bone back together. Even if it could, the horse needs to keep weight off the leg completely and support all of it's weight on three legs, stressing them greatly. This can lead to laminitis (a horse being \"lame\") which is *extremely* painful for the horse. \n\nThat's really the crux of it. Horse leg and hoof injuries are often really difficult to treat, if not impossible. Even if the injury is possibly treatable, the recovery is so long and so painful and so prone to reinjury that it is commonly though that the most humane way to deal with the horse is to put it down.",

        "question_ctx": "[removed]",
        "answer": "There's a variety of different techniques used, and prpbably others which we don't really know about since they're proprietary.\n\nOriginally CPUs were single cycle, that means that any individual operation  (read, write, add, subtract, compare, shift right, shift left) would all be completed within a single clock cycle. Because performing one operation requires a number of different things to happen (read, calculate, write and more), this is slow.\n\nSo processors developed to be multi-cycle, where you split up the operation so that each clock cycle gets the next bit ready along the chain. So while operation 1 is being computed, operation 2 can be read in preparation. This means that although it takes more than one clock cycle to do one operation, the CPU can be clocked at a higher rate meaning it ends up being faster overall. Modern CPUs take this to another level with pipelining, which improves this method even further.\n\nAnother thing they can use are look aheads and carry lines. The reason is that sometimes a future calculation needs the result of a previous one. If the pipeline is so long that both calculations are still processing through, then the result can be passed back to where it's needed, before its actually finished the whole pipeline process.\n\nOther improvements are in multipliers and floating point units (FPUs). You may have noticed that I didn't mention multiplication in the list of operations above. That's no mistake as the basic processor architecture can't do it (and don't even get me started on division). The old method (and sometimes still fastest for small and specific ones) is just to keep adding the right number of times. These days we often work with huge numbers, so this process is sped up by using special multiplication circuits which are separate from the normal processor elements. So that can be performing a multiplication while the rest of the processor is busy with other stuff. \n\nSimilarly the FPU is designed to deal with floating point numbers (ever heard supercomputer speed measured in teraflops? That's trillion floating point operations per second), which are a special way of using standard form numbers in the computer.\n\nEDIT: SOURCE: Electronic Engineering student. We designed and simulated  (on FPGA) simple processors like these last year; and are coding others in assembly language this year.",

        "answer": "For Weber rationalization relies highly on predictability. In order for a system to work, its practices and routines need to be predictable - that is, it needs to rely on a clear set of rules. Although bureaucracy is now widely though of in pejorative terms, Weber's notion of bureaucracy refers to the need of a formal, hierarchical system, based on meritocracy, that has a well defined, written set of rules. All this is meant to maximize efficiency. \n\nTo get a better grasp of your quotation, it may be helpful to think of a comparison between traditional and modern (industrial) societies forms of leadership. Thus, while a nobleman is a leader due to hes family status, a bureaucrat is appointed by merits. And so on... Here's a link that goes more into detail on the topic _URL_0_ and a short answer to your question on rationalization: \"For Weber the term bureaucracy was inseparable from the term rationality. And we may speak of his concept as a \"rational bureaucracy\" But what were the features developed to make bureaucracies rational? We have already met them: (1) functional specialization (2) clear lines of hierarchical authority, (3) expert training of managers, and (4) decision making based on rules and tactics developed to guarantee consistent and effective pursuit of organizational goals.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the concept of bureaucracy is an ideal type, meaning, it doesn't exist as such in the world, but it's rather used, say, as a guiding mark for debates on various phenomena related to it. Apparently Weber himself didn't believe in the widespread success of rationality, for this you can google a little about formal vs. substantive rationality.",

        "answer": "Its hard to be certain, because the Russian's will likely keep the exact techniques a secret, but here are some common and cutting edge strategies:\n\n1.) Ballistic missiles would typically depend on elliptical paths to take advantage of Earth's gravity field. However, using these paths makes the missile's location predictable. Expending more thrust energy to alter the path of the missile in flight makes it difficult to predict when and where it will arrive.\n\n2.) Missiles that go extremely quickly are harder to hit with either lasers or air defense missiles. This is the primary concern with the Chinese DF-21D, which \"re-enters\" at speeds of up to Mach 10. The NAVY has officially stated their missile defense capabilities are significantly diminished above Mach 5, which has motivated the development of directed energy weapons (lasers.)\n\n3.) Historically, nuclear missiles use what is called a MIRV warhead, or \"Multiple Indepedent Re-entry Vehicle.\" These warheads contain many nuclear warheads that fall in a guided fashion towards their targets. It may be beneficial to include some extra-bright fake warheads, with intentionally elevated heat signatures. These fake warheads draw fire from autonomous defense systems, and may mask the presence of real warheads.\n\n4.) Some proposed missile designs would drop to a low altitude prior to reaching their target and complete the last portion of their flight at an altitude below radar capability. I do not believe this is a realistic goal for a lot of reasons, but it is a theory.\n\n5.) Special radar-aborbing paints and materials can be used to reduce the radar signature of a missile.\n\n6.) Some experimental missiles may move so quickly that they develop a plasma sheath, and this plasma sheath may release radiation (light) in spectra that effectively occlude the missile. Think of it like looking at an oncoming motorcycle with those obnoxious headlights. You want to shoot the driver, but you can't pick out where he is behind all that light.\n\nThose are just some strategies, past, present, and future.",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "There are various methods an image can be resized. Programs use a resizing algorithm to calculate interpolation \u2013 which is the construction of new data points with an existing set of data points. In other words, with the pixels already provided, what are the new pixels will generate look like.\n\nThe simplest method is called Nearest Neighbor. This is the \"pixelated\" look that occurs when you scale an image using that algorithm. Microsoft Paint uses the Nearest Neighbor method of resizing. When the image is being resized, the new blank pixels that need to be filled up just looks at the nearest pixel and uses that color, paying little attention its other neighbors. This is why when resizing images that aren't values like 200%, 400%, etc. using the Nearest Neighbor method generally makes things much uglier and very pixel-choppy.\n\nThe more superior methods of resizing images are called Bilinear and Bicubic interpolation. I'd say that these methods do multiple checks and estimates at a much more refined way than a simple Nearest Neighbor / Pixel Resize would. Generally, Bicubic interpolation generates a better resized image with lesser artifacts (or that weird low-image quality fuzziness), but Bilinear generally is a lot faster. When speed is not an issue, Bicubic interpolation is the de facto way of image resizing. I'd say that web browsers typically would use this method.\n\nAn easy way to compare the resize methods is by having a graphics editing program like GIMP or Photoshop, then using a scaling command (or Transform) to see how an image would resize differently. Alternatively, you can just open up Microsoft Paint and a web browser with the same image.\n\nI found a website that gives visual details for the different methods and also provides some simple explanations... [Here you go](_URL_0_).\n\nI'd say in summary...\n\nWhen images are resized, the program makes a lot of educated guesses as to what those pixels it needs to fill up when the image has scaled. These refined guesses are called the Bicubic/Bilinear form of interpolation. Interpolation is creating new data from an existing set of points. The simple, pixelated look is considered Nearest Neighbor and is the simplest guess a program can make, but one of the least refined.\n\nEDIT: I don't have a whole lot of familiarity in the actual methods of scaling, as I've only used these methods in Photoshop and the like. If there is a fellow Redditor who has noticed any inaccuracies about my explanation or would like to refine it in any way, I'd be much appreciated. We're all here to learn, and I'd love to learn some neat things about this too. :)",

        "answer": "They are significantly heavier than a passanger car. They are more powerful, but not by that much. \n\nIn EU, a normal truck/trailer weights 40 tons, or about 30 times as much as a passanger car. They genereally have around 450 bhp (for \"normal\" road transports, ~200 to 750 bhp are available), or around 3 times as much as a passanger car. So 30 times the weight, 3 times the power. \n\nTo be able to start, you need a \"slower\" gear ratio. You still want to drive resonably fast, so you still need the fast gear ratios. \n\nA 450 bhp engine does only deliver 450 bhp at a certain speed. At both higher and lower speed, the power is lower. With more gears, you are more likely to end up at that speed when you drive. \n\nFuel efficiency works in a similar way: there is a sweet spot where you want to be at.\n\nThe ratio between the highest and lowest gear in a truck is about 20. The same for a passanger car is about 7. \n\nA more in-depth explanation is also the startability of the vehicle. When you start, the wheel does not rotate. The wheels will be connected to the clutch disc via the gearbox. The clutch disc will be disconnected from the engine side by moving the clutch disc away from the engine. The engine will have a lowest \"usable\" rotational speed (before stalling, before NVH problems), usually about 500 RPM. The clutch begins to close, but can not fully close before the speed of the engine and the speed of the transmission input shaft is equal. Some power is transfered via the clutch to accelerate the vehicle, and the clutch disc, towards the speed of the engine. However, this heats up the clutch, which must not overheat or it will be destroyed. This process is aided by a larger gear ratio in the gearbox, since you don't need to go as fast before you can close the clutch.",

        "answer": "Actually, yeah. There are ant-related species where a foreman can show up and roughen up a worker for slacking off.\n\nTo quote Wikipedia:\n\n > Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. ... Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.\n > \n > Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \"propaganda pheromones\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.\n > \n > Some ants produce sounds by stridulation, using the gaster segments and their mandibles. Sounds may be used to communicate with colony members or with other species.\n\n\nDespite what sci-fi teaches us, there is no actual hive mind. The individual ants simply follow their instincts as to what the group is doing. Humans are not dissimilar that way.",

There are two types of reproductive barriers that can develop, prezygotic (before an egg is fertilized) and postzygotic (after the egg is fertilized). Prezygotic barriers would be things like breeding at different times of the year, developing different courtship rituals, can't mechanically do it, or just an inability of the sperm to fertilize the egg. Postzygotic would be things like reduced viability or fitness of hybrid offspring or the hybrid offspring being infertile. Things like the mule (offspring of a horse and donkey) or liger (tiger and lion) are the result of postzygotic barriers.

About half of all pneumonia cases are bacterial, which can be treated with antibiotics and are less contagious. A third of all cases are viral, are very contagious, and can only be prevented with vaccines. The remainder are fungal or environmental, and vary in contagiousness and ease of treatment. Cigarette smoking is the most common chemical cause of pneumonia.\n\nPneumonia is more dangerous in the elderly because it can exacerbate problems they already have. For example, it can amplify the effects of heart disease, and the stress it puts on the immune system allows other potentially life threatening illnesses to manifest themselves. Their immune systems are also weaker, which allows infectious organisms causing the pneumonia to thrive whereas in younger people they could be more easily killed off.",

A lot of DC to DC convertors use feedback to know what voltage has been achieved and adjust the frequency accordingly. Hence as it goes closer to the final voltage the frequency might change which would result in a change in the pitch.\nThe technology can vary so much that its hard to say for sure if this was exactly what happened in your case but I have personally experienced a scenario where the pitch changed because of charging a capacitor this way.\nUsually they are supposed to be work above the audible range but I suppose sub harmonics might be responsible too.",

I am not saying they should join the E.U. but it seems like it would benefit them as well to be a bigger part of the community and then build their influence from within. Maybe I am wrong, but it seems like Europe would be willing and it is Russia that isn't\n\nWhy is that?",
        "answer": "*Note that when I say \"Europe,\" I mean Europe the continent and cultural entity as opposed to the European Union.*\n\nHistorically, Russia has always been unique among the countries of \"Europe,\" even the now post-Soviet Eastern European nations. Russia's numerous autocratic leaders (think Ivan IV, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, etc.) themed their leaderships, or periods therein, around furthering tolerance or rejection of European culture, norms, economics, politics, etc. \n\nNone of this is to say Russia is peripheral or separate from Europe. Far from it. It's just that it's history and geography have made it simultaneously both a part of \"Europe\" and a unique entity. This tension lies at the hear of Russian history and expresses itself periodically in times of crisis with bents in both a pro and anti-European direction, this crisis of course being the latter. It's Russia's way of trying to determine its relationship and identity relative to Europe and largely explains why it hasn't dived right into the European project. There was an [excellent article by Rakesh Krishnan Simha](_URL_0_) on this conflict in Russian identity. It was written before the Crimean crisis but remains extremely relevant.\n\nMore to the specifics of this particular crisis. Besides not being quite sure if it even is a part of Europe, Russia feels the need to assert its independence and clout particularly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Vladimir Putin, alongside many others in Russia, see NATO expansion into post-Soviet states, the economic crash post-collapse, and the independent activities of nations that were integral Soviet states as threatening to Russia's position in the world. Consequently, Russia takes a keen interest in what occurs on its borders and has now shown itself willing to intervene to alter the equation in its favor (Crimea, South Ossetia).\n\nWhether or not these countries would benefit from European integration is a larger question.

The network communications are down the whole time you're doing that, so you're likely to be discovered.  Edit: Also, your tap requires power for its laser.\n\nThis is different from copper wires, which you can connect to without cutting them apart.  If you grab the side of a copper wire with electricity running through it, some of the electricity goes into you right?  Well with phone/data cables, that electricity contains all of the data that was being transmitted, so you just got a copy of it.

        "answer": "Modern-day mainframes aren't quite the same thing as what we used to call mainframes.  In the older days, Mainframes were like the computer towers of desktop computers today.  They housed the CPU and main memory of the computer.  Computers were large and expensive, so rather than buying an individual computer for each user, they had one or two mainframes.\n\nOriginally, they accepted punch cards and similar forms of input.  Eventually, keyboards and monitors became more common, and mainframes began to have terminals connected to them.  Terminals are basically like desktop PCs, except that they didn't have their own CPU or hard drive.  Instead, they send all their input to the mainframe, which processed it and returned the results.  Basically, it was like having multiple monitors and keyboards attached to a single computer.\n\nNowadays, mainframes are more like giant servers.  Server blades are individual computers designed for fitting in server racks, and they don't have a built-in interface.  Instead, they're connected to via a terminal or a remote desktop connection, much like older mainframes.  They're usually used to host dedicated network resources, like storing files, hosting websites, or hosting video game servers.  They may or may not be connected to the internet, depending on the needs of the company that owns them.\n\nMainframes are similar to server racks.  Rather than having multiple individual machines each designed to run a single server load, mainframes are giant machines with a lot of power.  Depending on the needs of the company, they can use all of that power for a single purpose, like bulk data processing, or they can use *virtualization* to split it up as necessary.\n\nVirtualization basically creates an imaginary computer that can access a certain amount of resources of the larger machine.  Programs can talk to the virtual computer as if it were a real one, but there is no physical machine there.  This allows the owners of the mainframe to split up the resources as they see fit.  Depending on their needs, they can use the virtual machines as servers, virtual desktop computers, or something else entirely.\n\nAs far as I can tell, they will still be necessary in the future.  Mainframes can be have far more individual cores in their CPUs compared to a desktop or server blade, so they will continue to be useful even in the age of parallelization.  The only point I can see where we'll ever stop needing mainframes is the point where a single desktop machine is powerful enough to run high-end computations on large amounts of data.  Since the past trend has been that the more computing power we have, the greater number of computations we want to run on data, I don't see that happening any time soon.",

        "question_ctx": "From all that I have done research wise I am as confused as ever. \n\nI see articles saying that even if you don't count calories, you can lose weight if you use the keto diet method, and enter ketosis.\n\nI see articles saying there are direct connections between obesity and genetics, and for some people CICO plain doesn't work, and even if they undereat/eat normally, they will gain weight.\n\nI see articles that say that the trick to any weight loss is 100% CICO, expending more than we consume.\n\nI'm so confused, as many of these seem to contradict each other. Help?",
        "answer": ">  and for some people CICO plain doesn't work, and even if they undereat/eat normally, they will gain weight.\n\nThis is literally impossible. Like breaking the laws of physics impossible. Calories, really kilo-calories, are just the measurement unit of energy. Your body stores what it doesn't use. If you use more than you're taking in, it takes some out of it's stores (fat). \n\nThe idea that the stores of energy could increase *without bringing more in*, and while *burning more than you have* is literally impossible. \n\nWhat's really going on with those people who say that CICO doesn't work is that they're taking more calories in than they either know or are willing to admit, and they're burning fewer than they know/admit as well. They likely have no idea how many calories are really in something, and go over their limit frequently without ever knowing it (or they do know and don't want to fess up to the people doing the survey). This happens a lot. Just like how when your dentist asks if you brush twice daily and floss, you say yes because you feel bad admitting that you don't, when people are asked by their doctor or friends and family how much they eat or work out, they lie. Saying \"well I wanted to work out but I didn't, and I ended up eating a bag of Reeses cups while watching Netflix instead\" feels embarrassing. So they claims that they ate less than they did, and say they work out frequently when they don't.\n\n\nAnd they might not even know how many calories are in common things they eat. There are 87 calories in 1 Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. You have to work out pretty strenuously for a little over 5 minutes to burn that off (on average). People really have no idea how many calories exercise burns. It's pretty common to think that if you hit the treadmill for 15 minutes, huffing and puffing the whole time, sweating your ass off, that you got a good workout in a burned a bunch of calories. Nope, that 15 minutes on the treadmill wasn't even enough to cancel out **1** slice of pizza. Not even 1. So you get people who snack all day, drink a soda, get something they think is healthy from Jimmy Johns, but get a bag of chips as well. Grab a few candies from the bowl the secretary at work puts out. Have 4 slices of pizza at home, or more, and on and on. And before they know it, they're consuming 3,000-3,500 calories or more in one day, but thinking that because they spent 15 minutes on the treadmill and got a sub instead of McDonalds, they're gonna lose weight. They don't of course, because walking on a treadmill at Planet Fitness twice a week after work is not going to cancel out the candy, chips, soda, fast food, and other ultra-high calories crap they're casually eating for lunch, the Starbucks latte and muffin they had during breakfast, the little snacks throughout the day, or the rest. But they don't know that, so they think Calories In Calories Out doesn't work. No, it does, they're just doing it wrong.",

        "question": "How did baby boomers when they were young manage to pay for a house and raise a family while on single incomes (the dad working), yet today young couples can't even afford a small home and struggle to raise even one child while there's two incomes (mom and dad working)? What happened?",
        "question_ctx": "[removed]",
        "answer": "WARNING: long historical analysis in broad strokes, that will rile people up with reactionary emotional responses and down-votes follows...\n\nWages and costs were once in parity. The line on the graphs for worst, median, and best salary were basically the same shape as the line for cost to buy a home, cost to buy a car, cost to raise a kid, and so on.\n\nThen a particular and peculiar force took over the economy. People who'd read Ayn Rand (and similar nonsense) in the sixties became the makers of policy in the eighties. This brought us \"trickle down economics\" and corporate raiding and some other stuff. (Continued after aside...)\n\n{deleted}\n\nSo the other key thing that happened is that the racists switched from the Democratic party to the Republican party in the sixties and seventies.\n\nSee \"Democrat\" used to to be the party of \"institutions\", so business etc. these \"institutions\" included big business and racism was institutional before the Civil Rights Movement. This was an accident. If your government and business and your churches are all racist and you are in support of government and church and business, you got racist indoctrination as an underlayment.\n\nThe \"Republican\" was the party of \"individuals\" which _included_ the Unions and Workers Rights and the Civil Rights Movement itself.\n\nThe important thing here is that business interests and workers rights were on opposite sides. \n\nBut then the Civil Rights Act passed. Institutions, particularly government and business _banished_ racism.\n\nSo what's a racist to do? Well they switched sides.\n\nSo racism, my right to tell a ***** to (whatever) became an \"individual rights issue\". People switched parties in droves. The fine \"Democrat\" institution of the KKK etc, wanted to continue on, so the message of the Republican party sounded like what they wanted.\n\nThe thing is that a lot of business and social (church) power was carried across the divide because those people _owned_ those institutions and interests.\n\nYou have to look at the now-dead politicians of the age, the last to leave office or die being Strom Thurmond, who did the former by doing the latter. The pattern of defection from Democrat to Republican is historically obvious.\n\nEven today, some GOP partisans point out that the KKK was a Democrat institution, but they lack the sense of history to understand why they should be suspicious that the KKK is now on their side.\n\nSee the Civil Rights Movement was revolutionary instead of evolutionary, so the structures of power didn't properly realign properly. Basically a lot of people moved \"right\" all at once, while nobody was moving left.\n\nWith the business owners and the unions now in the same party one had to lose status. Businesses had the money. A union couldn't shut down a business without losing the union, but a business could shut down a union and benefit.\n\nAdd to that the fact that a lot of people just plain old _didn't_ _notice_ that the sides had switched up. The less educated you were, the less likely you were to read the papers, the easier it was to miss the fact that you might now be voting for the wrong side.\n\nUnionists had just _nobody_ to vote for because they \"knew\" \"Democrats were bad for unions\", and largely they _were_, having had no reason to change their tune. They still had a lot of business interest and whatnot, with no worker base.\n\nSo with the individual rights people, the unions, and the businesses all in the same pile the Republicans started dismantling what they'd built for the individuals. Their social support agenda, their actual pro-worker mandate, and their successful Social Security and Welfare programs were not in the interests of their new business buddies.\n\nSo the eighties were an orgasm of deregulation and \"corporate raiding\".\n\nSee the Objectivists came of age but landed in charge of the side that is supposed to protect workers interests. So they just let go of their side of the rope and started pushing it towards the right, and the Democrats were pulling to the right out of habit.\n\nBasically the Republicans leapfrogged over the Democrats so that the entire political spectrum was just slewing to the side we now call \"right\".\n\nThe democrats eventually realized that someone needed to be on the left, but by then the damage had been done.\n\nAt this point, with nobody protecting individual incomes of the working middle class, and even the working upper class, the wage growth lines basically flatten out for everybody who isn't a business _owner_.\n\nThe Objectivists and the business men dismantle regulation.\n\nThe Savings and Loan system collapses, and the barriers between the three types of banks (commercial, investment, and ~~housing~~ consumer) disappear. Now banks that are supposed to anchor commercial and individual (worker) interest are free to gamble, which creates a series of bubbles and bursts that the workers and government interests have to support because the firewall around risky investment is _gone_ and investment banks can no longer be allowed to fail because they'll take business and personal interests down in the blast.\n\nMeanwhile, medical care has become for profit. Kaiser-Perminante (if memory serves) was the first non not-for-profit hospital, but once that barrier was pierced the HMOs and the for-profit hospitals took over in a tide.\n\nThe private institution of higher education has always been a thing, but with deregulation of student loans and the really broad application of the GI bill - and with the lack of political champions for education - tuition became a gold mine for schools. This happened right as the lust-for-advancement of the fifties was dying off. The dream of the twenties, thirties, and forties that science was going to solve everything died during a duck-and-cover exercise somewhere along the way.\n\nAnother regulation limited how many media companies any one business interest could control. With the death of that just a few businesses, a few _huge_ businesses, can now \"set the message\". \"Greed is good\", \"they're poor because they are lazy\", \"more deregulation will solve the problems of deregulation\", \"free markets now\" (which is great for business but hell on workers). An endless series of messages that somehow just never understand that working people create value.\n\nDemocrats are slowly taking up the interests of the individual workers, the unions, the environment, and all the things that the Republicans dropped.\n\nBut terrific damage has been done. The economy and deregulation have left the vast majority of people far, far away from where they are supposed to be.\n\nMeanwhile lots of people are one issue voters, voting for gun rights and electing people who want to remove every other law in their favor as a consequence.\n\nFurther still, there are people who've just got a formula for god-and-country or all-democrats-are-thieves (a leftover from when all democrats were businessmen).\n\nAnd still further the \"big government is bad\" meme and the \"tax and spend\" meme that sits like a turd, ignoring the fact that the alternative is \"borrow and spend\".\n\nSo the answer to your question is that someone \"scrambled the teams\" and orphaned the interests of the moderate worker who just wants a _fair_ wage for _everybody_. Poor people vote republican because they think of Democrats as \"elitists\" because in the forties they _were_; that vote being totally blind to electing people who literally own elite country clubs. Rich people vote republican because it's good for their bank accounts. But then the republicans vote to dismantle _their_ _own_ prior policies that made our workforce so amazing and egalitarian. Meanwhile the Democrats are in a three-decades-long shell-shock identity crisis and our economy is slowly deflating as the money pours into the pockets of the ultra-rich.\n\nQUICK UPDATE:\n\n- Thanks for the gold!\n\n- Yes, this is USA-Centric. That's where I grew up. But if you look at our history of treaties and our role in the cold war, which was contemporary with this whole thing, and our control of two of the big-four world stock markets, it's pretty easy to see how we _exported_ our worst ideas to the rest of \"the western world\". \n\n- I was alive for lots of this. I was born in 1964. I remember desegregation. I was initially republican. I am democrat now, but for lack of choice. As long as the U.S. has \"simple majority rule\", as in you need 50% plus one guy to win, the math just gives any three-way split to the dominant party in the House, so we can't have nice things like a third party.\n\n- No, I didn't \"forget about women entering the workforce\", nor the \"illegal immigrants\"... nor automation. The continuous boogey-man of new workers is a role that has gone to Blacks, Irishmen, Scottsmen, Chinamen, and every other racist label you can think of. By always having some people forced to take slave-labor wages you can drive down the labor market artificially. Whenever fair labor laws change this for the current out-group we've seen economic booms.\n\n- \"Kaiser Permanente\" is not-for-profit, but \"Kaiser Perminante Medical Group\" is a wholly owned for-profit entity. These sorts of distinctions are important. Sorry for confusing you.\n\n- No, I am not a \"Communist\", if you think everybody who references \"workers\" is a communist then you need to study the history of labor over the last 3 thousand years.\n\n- Yes, this is \"biased\". Facts tend to be biased for having only one actual, factual condition.\n\n- No, I didn't include _your_ pet theory, write your own post.\n\n- Character cap limits specificity in some areas.\n\n- No, this was not for literal five year old children. Read the rules in the side bar. 8-)\n\nEDIT2:\n\n- look up \"Republican Southern Strategy\" it was that deliberate and done in plain sight.",

        "answer": "The number of neutrons in an atom is just determined by the way it was formed.  For instance, [this atom of uranium-235](_URL_1_) is splitting into krypton-92 and barium-141.  Here the barium atom has 85 neutrons just because that's how it was created (it has nothing to do with nuclear stability or whatever).\n\n\n**However**, if an atom has an unstable combination of protons and neutrons, it will decay.  Krypton-92 and barium-141 are both pretty unstable, so they won't be around very long.\n\n\nThe result is that pretty much anything you come across will be made of only stable isotopes.  [Here is a table](_URL_0_) showing the stability of various isotopes.  Each column is an element (an atom with a certain number of protons), which each row is a certain number of neutrons.  Each cell in the chart is a specific isotope.  The color of the cell tells you how stable it is.  For instance, both hydrogen-1 (no neutrons) and hydrogen-2 (one neutron) are completely stable.  Hydrogen-3 has a half life of 12 years, and hydrogen-4 has a half life of 10^-22 seconds.  (I included H-4 to illustrate that nuclear stability is not binary, i.e. there's different levels of instability.)\n\n\nThis brings up another question:  \"What determines the stability of each isotope?'  I think this is what you really wanted to know.  Unfortunately, the answer is pretty complicated.\n\n\nIf you've taken some chemistry, you can imagine nuclear stability as being sort of analogous to ionic stability.  For instance, noble gasses are unreactive because the are stable, and they are stable because they have full electron shells.  Similarly, certain numbers of nucleons (protons + neutrons) make for stable nuclei.  Just as the explanation for electronic stability requires understanding the quantum mechanics of electrons, the explanation for nuclear stability requires understanding the quantum mechanics of nucleons.",

        "question": "Why do you need a flu vaccine every year, when other vaccines last for many years? And if it's because the flu virus is adapting, why don't the other vaccine diseases also adapt?",
        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "You are spot on with the adaptation of the flu virus. The flu virus has a very special way of adapting that other viruses we get vaccinated against tend to lack. \n\n**Analogy for Flu Infection**\n\nLet's just say a cell is a series of doors with a factory in the middle. There is a set of doors to get into the factory, there is a lock that needs to be opened to operate the factory, and their is a special set of doors to get out of the factory. The factory has guards inside who cannot easily detect camouflage. The viral particles have keys to get in, use the factory, and get back out safely, but the locks on the doors are continually switched. The viruses also have camouflage, but once the guards recognize it, it no longer works at all.\n\n\n So basically, an individual viral particles needs to possess the key to get in, the key to operate the machines, the key to get out, and the proper camouflage to be successful. In segmenting it's genome, the flu virus quickly evolves new keys and better camouflage quicker than the factory security can keep up with. Some viruses including certain strains of the flu  have already been locked out permanently because they have already been detected by security. These new flu individuals that come along have either a new key in, a new key out, or better camouflage, so they are more successful than the viruses that have already been caught.  If a virus comes along that has the best camouflage and keys, it will be very effective at stealing the machinery and spreading. Since this virus is now the best as spreading, it will likely infect more hosts, making it the most prevalent strain in the population. \n\n\nHowever, a security company (scientists) is tired of all the break ins. They developed a way to change the locks before the virus can even get into the factory. The vaccine is basically a way of teaching the factory security what they should look for, and changes the locks on the building to prevent break ins.  \n\n**Genome and Mutation**\n\nThe Flu virus has a segmented genome, meaning the single genome (containing all of the genetic information) of the flu virus is broken into many pieces within the infectious capsid (protective protein coat). When 2 variations of the flu virus infect 1 host, you have a phenomenon known as co-infection, which causes [antigenic shift](_URL_1_). 2 viruses in the same host accidentally get their segments switched creating an entirely new viral particle. The flu also just makes simple mistakes when copying itself, which leads to [antigenic drift](_URL_0_). Viral particles are so numerous and careless, they have the ability to mutate and evolve quickly. Most cells have methods of proofreading genetic material after it has been replicated, but this requires special machinery. A virus lacks this ability because it is too small for the genome to code for any of these cellular DNA repair machines. So instead the viral particles just take a simple strategy of replicating quickly and just hoping there are some functional particles after the process (from what I've heard, only about 1/400 particles is actually functional). \n\n**Where does a flu strain come from?**\n\nWhen a human shares a house with cows, pigs, or chickens (poor rural areas) there is an ability of humans and animals to share flu strains. One strain of the flu that has been passing around the chicken population has the potential to infect a cow that is already infected with the cow version of the flu. This co-infection event has the potential to breed a new strain of the flu.

There are a few killer strains of the flu on their way eventually, but hopefully scientists can predict the strain and produce enough of a vaccine to effectively prevent infection of the majority of the human population. Most of the flu viruses we encounter are not completely new, so our body detects and attacks them. These particles share some sort of resemblance to a previous flu we had, and share some of the genome segments with that flu. The issue arises when a completely new strain evolves that the human population has never encountered, so we have no natural resistance to it. This new flu can evolve by antigenic shift, drift, or both.\n\n**Edit:** For clarity.",

        "question": "how can a Kingdom become an Empire? Or vice versa",
        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "If you are asking about formal requirements that really depends in what area of the and the culture we're talking about. Outside of the Western/European tradition the titles can be confusing and I don't think there really is a proper \"emperor\" other than the \"high king\" meaning \"king over other kings\" as in the Middle Eastern or Asian traditions. The actual term \"Emperor\" is pretty unique to Western culture.  For example Mongols had *khans* and \"great khans\". India had *rajas* (rulers of a *raj* - a kingdom) and *maha*rajas.\n\nIn reality as most things in politics it is due to some tradition. If you are interested read on:\n\n----\n\nEmperor comes from the Latin word \"Imperator\" which translates roughly into \"ruler of men\". Ancient Rome had two concepts describing relationships of power : imperium and dominium. Dominium was the rule over inanimate objects, wealth, land, slaves. This is where *dominus* and *domina* come from. This is why Christians address God \"Dominus\" and not \"Imperator\" - because Christian God is the lord of creation. This is also where the word \"dominatrix\" comes from - as a bastardized feminine version of \"domina\". Imperium was the rule over men and the title \"Imperator\" was given to a leader of Roman legions, also as a honorific after receiving a triumphs. For example after his campaign in Gaul Ceasar was the \"Imperator of the Gallic Legions\".  The Roman Emperors never used the title \"emperor\" formally until very very late - when Rome was turned into a proper monarchy called \"dominate\" (late 4th century AD). And even then the title was \"Augustus\" or - previously - \"Princeps\" (First). That's the explanation where the word comes from. \n\nThe difference between a king and an emperor is slightly more than just ceremonial. In the European tradition *a* king was a ruler that was a sovereign confirmed by the Catholic church. If you wanted to be a king you had to have enough land and subjects and influence and power so that the pope would agree to proclaim you a king and legitimize your right to rule.  You could style yourself a \"king\" in your own language if that was your custom but you wouldn't be *the* king unless you converted to Christianity and accepted the religious primacy of the Roman church and - depending on the political circumstances - political primacy of the Roman Emperor. The word for \"king\" in Latin was *rex* and was derived from  the word *regnum* which translates into \"kingdom\" but which literally means \"dominion, rule, domain\".  This is why in Latin a king is \"rex\" but a queen regnant is \"regina\".\n\nIn other words an emperor is the ruler of men while a king is just a ruler of a given domain (of land etc) and that's how it was in Christendom for most of the middle ages.\n\n----\n\n*The* emperor was initially only one - Roman Emperor - who ruled over Roman Empire which at the time was Christian by decree. The things started getting complicated when the Catholic church started dividing - because monarchical rule was at the time very dependent on divine mandate - god saying that you are the rightful ruler and people should obey you.  \n\nFirst it was the creation of Orthodox churches in opposition to Roman Catholic Church. That allowed for two \"popes\" (the Pope and the Patriarch) and two \"emperors\" after Rome split into two with emperors in Rome and Constantinople.  \n\nWhen Rome fell in 476 soon  the Roman tradition was being moved partly through Frankish kings in the Merovingian dynasty up to the re-birth of the Roman Empire (this time in name only) under Charlemagne. Then one of his sons got the title and moved on to create the Holy Roman Empire in the Frankish kingdoms which now are called Germany. The title of the Holy Roman Emperor over time became a semi-hereditary title supported by the electors The last Holy Roman Emperor was a Habsburg and had the capital in Vienna until 1806.\n\nSo for a very long time in the Christian/European sphere of influence there were only two \"emperors\". The Holy Roman Emperor (*Imperator Romanorum* of the *Imperium Sacrum Romanum* - all in Latin because that was the former Western Empire) and the Byzantine emperor called in Greek (becuase that was the Eastern Empire) *Basileus* (after Byzantium moved to Greek as the official language in 620, before he was *Augustus* in Latin).\nThere were two emperors because each one of them claimed the legacy and legitimacy of the \"original\" Roman emperor. Byzantium wasn't really called \"Byzantium\" at the time - it was \"Roman Empire\" (*Basilea Romaina* in Greek) and technically it had the capital of \"proper\" Rome since it was moved there by emperor Constantine in 3rd century AD ( Hence Constantinople - the city of Constantine). The political schism really came about as a result of the religious nature of the ruling mandate. Since Rome still was the seat of Catholic church and the pope they claimed the right to nominate emperors while patriarchs in Constantinople did the same. Since they couldn't really claim \"regular\" Roman Empire  since the final fall of Rome in 476 they reclaimed \"Holy\" Roman Empire within the new Christian sphere of influence in the West.\n\nThis lasted until 1453 when Ottomans conquered Constantinople. Then the seat of the Orthodox church moved to Russia and the Russian *Tsar* titled himself an \"emperor\" and Moscow - the new seat of the Orthodox church - became the \"third Rome\". They maintained the tile of Tsar until Peter the Great who rejected many Russian/Eastern/Asiatic traditions and decided to modernize his country and took to styling himself \"Emperor of Russia\". Again at the time there were two emperors both claiming religious mandate - the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna backed by the Roman Catholic church and the Pope and the Emperor in Russia backed by the Orthodox Church and the Patriarch of Moscow.  \n\n----\n\nThen came the French Revolution and the legitimization of power moved from divine mandate to will of the people (or something) and Napoleon Bonaparte called himself *The Emperor of the French* (Notice: not of France. Remember what I wrote earlier about kings and emperors, imperium and dominium ). When he defeated Austria he also forced the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the abdication of the Holy Roman Emperor into an *Austrian Emperor* because Bonaparte saw himself as continuing the traditions of Charlemagne who in his opinion was both French and the rightful *Emperor*. \n\nAfter that all bets were off and people went out styling themselves \"Emperor\" quite openly. Napoleon III called himself Emperor and the France under his rule an Empire. Germany got an Emperor who was just a king before unification. Austria maintained an Emperor. Russia had an Emperor following reforms of Peter the Great.   Britain had an Emperor outside of traditional domains (India). Naturally the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was styled \"Emperor\" too. Suddenly everyone could be an emperor if they had the army to back it up.\n\nThat's when \"empire\" became what we know today - a huge political entity comprising many nations and states often with their own rulers who are subject to some degree to another ruler (the emperor). That's why the USSR was considered informally an \"empire\" and why today we speak of \"American empire\".\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR**  \n\nOriginally the titles \"emperor\" and \"king\" had proper meaning within the domain of the Roman Catholic church. An Emperor was the political leader of all Christendom while Kings were just sovereign rulers of portions of land with some limited general sovereignty over local feudal lords.  It lasted for as long as Holy Roman Empire lasted and it was meant to emulate the ancient Roman political order.\n\nThen the French revolution came and after it Napoleon Bonaparte who considered himself a better \"emperor\" than the traditional emperor in Vienna. He proclaimed himself as one but didn't force the original emperor to abdicate the full title (just the \"Roman\" part which was annoying to Bonaparte). So that meant there were three emperors - French, Austrian and Russian - and only two of them claimed mandate by tradition/religion/whatever. Since then an Emperor was just a really powerful king who had more than one king as a formal or informal subject. That's why *Queen* Victoria of Great Britain was also *Empress* of India - because there were \"kings\" in India over whom she held political power. \n\n ----\n\nEDIT: formatting",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "Yes!  Irregular verbs are almost always some of the *oldest* verbs in a language.\n\nAs a language evolves, it will pick up other forms, either from absorbing other similar words, or picking up new verbs from other languages or new uses for old ones, etc.  You end up standardizing those verb forms as more people use them, according to the very common, very obvious rules in the language.\n\nFor a modern example to demonstrate this, take the verb \"to google\", meaning to look something up on the internet.  That's a very modern verb, only showing up in the last decade or so for obvious reasons (_URL_0_ didn't exist before then).  So if I give you nothing but \"to google\" you instinctively know how to conjugate that:\n\n* I googled\n\n* I have googled\n\n* He is googling\n\nIt follows the rules pretty well.  \"To google\" is replacing a verb, though: \"to search\".  It's easy to replace \"to search\" with \"to google\" culturally, and in fact some people use \"to google\" outside of the internet, as in \"let me google my shoes and I'll be ready to go.\"\n\nYou can't do that with very common words, though.  The verb \"to be\" is one that you use *every single day*, all the time.  You probably use \"to search\" often enough, but...you may not actually use it every day.  You can replace \"to search\" but you can't replace \"to be\" because it's such an integral part of the language.  It's really an integral part of *any* language (or at least, any language that has it - Russian doesn't).  In English especially, it's used as modals for other verb forms: \"I will **be** searching for a new car soon\".\n\nThat makes \"to be\" very hard to standardize because everyone already knows from a very young age exactly how \"to be\" is conjugated.  It doesn't matter that it's weird - it's been weird for centuries, it's not going to change any time soon.  If you introduce a new word to someone, they're likely to listen to you to pick up on how to conjugate it, and it's probably going to get conjugated normally.  But if it's a word they already know, a word they use all the time, they're going to keep doing it the way they've always done it, right?  How it got to be weird, though, follows the same patterns of absorbing new verb forms.\n\nLet's take the word \"to go\" since I actually know how that one happened off the top of my head.  You might think \"How did 'I go' turn into 'I went'?\"  Well, there used to be another verb \"to wend\", which has become more or less obsolete.  You might recognize it as a distant relative of \"wander\", but it's mostly no longer a part of our lexicon.  \"To wend\" meant something very similar to \"to go\" and people used them interchangeably more often than not.  Eventually, the past tense of \"to wend\" (ie: went) replaced the past tense of \"go\" and stuck there.  Since it was something everyone used all the time, it never had an opportunity to get fixed.  Likewise, \"to be\" picked up different verb forms to become \"am\" and \"are\" and \"is\" and never got fixed because everyone already knows how to conjugate \"to be\".  In fact, its weirdness helps stick it even harder in the lexicon, like the plural form \"oxen\".  *Everyone* knows that the plural of ox is \"oxen\" even though that's literally the only word in English that does that, *because* it's the only word in English that does that.  And our irregular verbs stick in our memory because they're irregular.\n\nThat also keeps them in the lexicon longer.  You can replace a word you don't use all the time, making the older one obsolete.  You can't replace words that you have to use every day, though, because everyone else is also using that same word and you won't be understood.  For that reason, irregular verbs are *old*.  They're kind of irregular *because* they are old, usually some of the oldest verbs in a language.\n\nEnglish is pretty bad about picking up irregular verbs, because we're really good at absorbing words from other languages.  How that works is another ELI5 entirely.  But other languages still have irregular verbs for the same reasons English does.  In Spanish, ser is irregular because, again, it's *old* and, like in English, you're going to be saying \"to be\" a lot.  The same goes for the other Spanish irregular verbs: haber (to have), tener (to have), ir (to go), estar (to be)...  You'll find in any language, the irregular verbs are almost always going to be very common, everyday verbs, and they're going to be some of the oldest words in a language.",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "Not an American, but the big advantage of a national debt in very basic terms is that you have a lot of money. You can use that money to stimulate the economy.  \n  \nFor example, imagine you want to start a business selling widgets. You can go and get a small business loan, then spend that on a small widget making machine. Then you can sell those to make enough money to pay back the loan. But instead of that, you want your business to grow. You don't want it to just sit there making a half dozen widgets here or there, as some bigger widget company will overtake you and you'll be out of business. You've got to grow. So you take out a bigger loan. You buy an industrial widget maker, and hire some widget machine operators and train them, and rent factory space. Now you're making more money, and you could start paying that loan back, but the other widget companies are encroaching. You've got to keep up. You've got to get a larger factory with a bigger loan. Then you need more factories. Then overseas manufacturing centers, and HR departments, and security guards and offices with desk tidies and little signs that say \"You don't have to be mad to work here but it helps!\" and it all adds up, and you're looking at how much you owe, and you realise the only way to pay it back would be to stop expanding, but if you stop expanding and advertising and growing you'll be overtaken in the market, and no-one will think your widgets are the best anymore and if they think that, then people might start asking for the loans back sooner, or not offering you loans, or charging more interest, and you soon realise the perception of your widgets is as important as the widgets themselves and you've locked yourself into a vicious cycle where you can never stop borrowing or the whole house of cards will collapse.  \n  \nBut you're making lots of widgets.

        "question": "How could life/metabolic processes come from nothing?",
        "question_ctx": "Obviously this is a huge question but I'm wondering what science's best theories are right now. How could chemical reactions create something that essentially \"wants\" those chemical reactions. Where does life come into a universe of rock and chemicals? ",
        "answer": "Great question. This is a tough one to explain, but I'll give it a go:\n\nI want to start by saying that life doesn't necessarily \"want\" those chemical reactions to keep going on. There is a concept in physics and chemistry called entropy, which relates to the \"randomness\" and disorder of chemicals and molecules. The concept of entropy is pretty much saying that the most likely outcomes will happen, as opposed to other unlikely outcomes.\n\nFor example, if you were to put five numbered balls in a bag and randomly take them out, odds are that when you remove them, the balls will not be in numerical order. But it COULD HAPPEN. Now, imagine doing the same thing with billions and trillions and even more numbered balls. This is the same concept as atoms. Any arrangement of atoms COULD happen, but the likelihood of that happening decreases if it is not energetically favorable.\n\nNow with this being said, it seems to contradict the fact that life is here. To explain this, we have Biophysics. Biophysics is a branch of physics and biology that examines life, and the chemistry that makes life, from a physics perspective. Instead of focusing on what is typically viewed as biology principles, it focuses more on the biochemistry and molecular biology. While life seems complex, and from the surface looks like it is incredibly unlikely to form, biophysicists have found that in many processes are in fact energetically favorable.\n\nOne example of something that seems unlikely while looking at the big picture, but that makes sense when looked at from a biophysics perspective, is our cell membranes (the outside layer of each cell that contains all the internal cellular components). The cell membrane layer is arranged in a very organized and specific way that allows life to occur and differentiate between the inside and outside of the cell. It seems unlikely that something so perfect would form because it would make more sense for these molecules to be randomly organized (as entropy told us they would).\n\nBUT, when looked at from a physics perspective, the \"randomness\" is actually increasing. It turns out the molecules which make the cell membrane (which are fat molecules), interact with the water around them if they cannot interact with themselves. If one fat molecules don't aggregate together to form certain shapes with other fat molecules, it will be surrounded by many water molecules in an \"organized manner.\" The principle of entropy tells us the universe wants to become more random and disorganized. So by aggregating together in specific ways (that look like they would not occur randomly), the fat molecules are actually increasing the total randomness because the water molecules around them are behaving \"more randomly.\"\n\nAnother example of this is the enzymes that are inside of our cells. Enzymes are molecules that our cells make that make certain reactions occur more rapidly. They do not change the entropy (or likelihood) of a reaction occurring, but make those reactions occur more quickly at a level that can sustain life.\n\nSorry if this was too long and complicated, but I hope it answers your question.\n\ntldr; Even though many of the processes and molecules in life seem like they would not randomly occur from afar, when looked at from a physics perspective it makes sense why the universe \"essentially wants this to occur\"",

However by my calculation there are 282,475,249 possible 7 digit phone number combinations (7^10 ) which is close to the population of the United States (~318,900,000 people). How can we be running out of phone numbers in such a small area if the number of possible phone numbers is so close to the population of the ENTIRE U.S.?",
        "answer": "As others have stated, your math is incorrect, there are only 10,000,000 possible numbers. But that gets reduced even further:\n\nPhone numbers can't start with 0 or 1, so there's 2 million numbers right there that are completely invalid. 200-0000 is the first possible valid phone number. Anything beginning with 555 is invalid, so remove 10,000 more numbers from the pool of valid numbers. Now, any x11 prefix is invalid too. Those are reserved for information, 911, etc. 80,000 more numbers out of the pool. So an area code only has fewer than 8 million possible valid numbers.\n\nNow it gets more complicated. Numbers have historically been assigned to carriers in blocks of 10,000 - basically, a telecom company owns a prefix. With number portability, this line has been blurred somewhat, my phone number is an AT & T owned prefix because they were my first cellular carrier, but I'm on T-Mobile. But, nonetheless, a smaller local carrier might own a block of 10,000 numbers, say with the 321 prefix, but only be using 2,000 of them. In the meantime, Verizon is quickly running out of free numbers in the dozens of blocks they own in an area code. They can't assign numbers out of the 321 prefix because they don't own it. So an area code could be running out of numbers when major carriers can't get any more free blocks, even if there are some free numbers in it.\n\nNow, you have landlines, mobile phones, business lines (some offices may have hundreds, if not thousands of incoming numbers in an area code). Tablets and other devices on a cellular network have a phone number assigned too even though the number can't be used for anything. Between my cell phone, LTE iPad, office phone, and home security system which uses the cellular network as a backup, I'm using 4 phone numbers.

Strengthening/enlarging the heart is only one of the adaptations that cardio workouts cause in the body, many others (increased mitochondria in the muscles, greater concentration of haemoglobin in blood, increased efficiency of waste product removal, etc) all occur at the same time because they are all part of the same job in the big picture...they all work together to deliver oxygen to working muscles. This means you get better at delivering oxygen and can work harder (run faster) as a result.\n\nMy training's in exercise physiology so the rest is more of a guess.\n\nDoing cocaine is a stimulant that will increase HR but to no end.

        "question": "What causes lightning, and why do snowstorms never/rarely cause it while rainstorms often do?",
        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "First I'm going to detail why thunder and lightning happen at all. If you already know that, skip down to the word \"EDIT\" to read about why they don't happen in the winter.\n\nWhen the liquid and crystalline particles in the clouds collide, sometimes electrons get knocked off. This causes an excess of negative charge to build up in the cloud. Like magnets, partials of the same charge repel each other. If you force enough of them into the same place, and then move them near a surface, they will jump to the other surface where they can spread out more. Have you ever touched an object and felt a shock? That's the exact same process. The surface you touched had much more free electrons than your skin did, so they jumped to you and you felt a shock. In the case of lightning, the charge is jumping from the clouds to the ground. This is a massive distance (when you feel shocks, the distance is usually on the scale of centimeters) for an electric charge to jump, and it only happens when there is a really gigantic difference in charge. That's why lightning is so much more powerful than static electricity.\n\nBonus answer: \"Okay, what about thunder?\"\n\nThunder is caused by lightning. When the massive electric shock passes through the air, it causes a vacuum. The area where the lightning bolt used to be suddenly has no particles in it. Air rushes to fill the vacuum and collides with air coming in from the other side. The molecules slam into each other with such force that you can hear the collision, just like you can hear it when two cars collide. This sound is called thunder.\n\nInterestingly, most people say \"Thunder and Lightning,\" not \"Lightning and Thunder.\" Yet lightning always comes first, and you even see lightning first, so even when the physics was not understood, lightning was known to come first. Yet people associate thunder first in their minds.\n\nEDIT: Looks like I missed the important part of the question: Why not in snow storms. The answer is that the reason the liquid and crystalline partials are colliding is because of updrafts. The liquid particulates occur in the lower (warmer) region of the cloud and the crystalline in the upper (colder) areas. This temperature discrepancy causes what are known as \"updrafts.\" Warm air naturally rises and cold air sinks, and so there is a constant upwards surge of air from the lower side of the clouds and a constant downwards surge from the upper end of the clouds. These surges of air carry along with it the particles of water and ice and are why they collide. The strength of these surges is dependent on the temperature differential. The greater the differential, the stronger and more frequent the internal gusts. In the winter, everything is much colder on earth, but there is a much smaller change in the atmospheric temperature, and the higher up you go, the less the temperature changes with the seasons. This means that the lower side of the clouds are going to be much colder in the winter, while the upper side will not. Thus the temperature differential is much lower. Lower the temperature differential enough, and the particles don't hit each other frequently enough to build up a static charge, and in each individual collision, there is a much smaller change of an electron getting knocked off. In the winter of most temperate regions, such as much of the Unites States and Europe, the temperature differential becomes too low for anything to happen at all. The exception to this is caused when snowstorms move onto the coast off of the water. The warmer ocean waters cause the lower clouds to be warmer than they would be if they had formed over land, and there is a chance, not frequent, but a chance, of lightning if the storm is particularly strong.\n\nTL;DR Lightning is caused when partials rub against each other in the clouds. The particles collide because strong winds blow between regions of the clouds of different temperatures. In the winter, the colder regions are not much colder but the warmer regions are a lot colder, so there is very little temperature differential, thus no updrafts, thus no collisions, thus no lightning.",

        "answer": "The \"p\" in those numbers don't mean \"pixels\". It means \"progressive\".\n\nIn the old days (when I was a kid *sob*), we had CRT TVs (not LCDs). The way those TVs worked is that they would rapidly paint the picture by shining a ray of light on the back of the screen you're looking at, which is coated with phosphors on the inside. Those phosphors would glow.\n\nIt would scan across from left to right (right to left? it doesn't matter) very rapidly, and after each row it would drop down and scan the next row underneath. It would do this so quickly that it would scan the entire screen several times per second (like 30). The phosphors would glow long enough that to your eye, it looks like a constant picture.\n\nWell, it turns out those TVs were so blurry that it didn't need to scan every row. It could skip every other one and only scan the odd rows, then on the next pass it would scan the even rows. It was still happening so fast that you couldn't really see much of a difference. This technique of skipping rows every other pass is called \"interlacing\". Those TVs had 240 scan lines on them, so each pass the ray would excite 120 lines of phosphors, alternating between evens and odds. The resolution of these TVs is 240i, or 240 scan lines, interlaced. (Actually, maybe it was 320 in the US, I forget.)\n\nWhen LCDs came along, it turned out that you can see interlaced scanning with the much sharper picture. If you see a horizontal line, you could clearly see it \"shimmer\" as every other row of pixels was switched on at half the frame rate of the video. So they started broadcasting video by scanning every line, known as \"progressive\" scan, giving 2x the quality.\n\nThis is what the \"p\" means in those numbers. So Blu-ray quality video means 1080 scan lines, progressive, or 1080p.",

The US President effectively combines the roles of head of state and head of government, which is sometimes problematic in terms of diplomacy: a recent petition (signed by 1.8 million people) called on the government not to accord President Trump the honour of a full state visit due to controversies surrounding his conduct as head of government.\n\nIn the last few centuries, the role of monarch has declined, and since Victoria has kept out of party politics altogether -- in public, that is.

It's also unclear just how much influence she does have on government policy, since the details of her meetings with the PM are confidential. It is known that Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, once complained that if the queen could vote, she would vote Liberal Democrat. The murky nature of her exact role, given that she is unelected and accountable only to constitutional law (whatever that may be on a given day), obviously makes a lot of people nervous. On the other hand, given her very long reign (her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill), her experience may well be extremely useful.\n\nDiplomatically, she performs a role that is arguably very important. As head of state, she meets other heads of states, and that certainly helps to oil the complex machinery of international relations.

It's that a bunch of the earth's cycles now operate significantly differently.  This leads to dramatically different weather patterns and sea levels, which pose risks for civilization.  It's not inherently *bad*, it's just risky for humans and what we have built.\n\nIf you need an analogy to reason through this, think of human body temperature.  It's normally around 98.6F.  Crank it up to 102F, and you're very sick.  Keep it at 102F for an extended period, and you are suffering, sick, and probably(?) eventually die.  And if your body temperature stays at 95F for an extended period of time, you suffer and probably(?) die.  That's an example of a system that runs into serious problems if its temperature changes by a few degrees.\n\nAs for filtering carbon out of the air, there are three main problems.  The first is that this process would require tons of energy.  The second is that it would have to be deployed at a positively ENORMOUS scale.  We emit 36 billion *tons* of carbon per year.  The third problem is what to do with all of that carbon, do we turn it back into oil and bury it, or what?  And the last problem is, of course, the astronomical cost.\n\nScience can make carbon filtration systems, they already operate on some power plants.  It is possible.

        "answer": "It is a theoretical model, that has been proven through experiment. \n\nImagine someone gives you a gift. It is a hollow metal sphere but it is packaged in a box. You have no idea what the gift is, but decide to do some experiments to find out, without actually opening the box. \n\nFirst you shake the box and it moves around. This tells you it is relatively light. Then, knowing that it is light, you move it slowly and you feel it rolling. This tells you that it is probably round. Now you are trying to find out what it is made of. You apply heat to the box, then shake to see if it has melted but it has not. You suspect that it is a strong but light material, like a metal alloy - since initial shake tests didn't break it can't be brittle. So you decide to touch magnets to the surface of the box. The object does not move and stays attracted to the magnet. This tells you it is metallic. Since it is metallic and relatively light, you suspect, it is hollow. So, you poke a hole in the box, and fill it with water. Comparing the volume of the box, with the volume of water you filled will tell you the size of the object. From this, you can choose a metal-alloy based on the magnetic strength recorded and estimate how hollow it is.\n\nAll this has been concluded, without actually seeing the sphere. Still, you can only speculate what colour the sphere is or whether it has dimples or not. But from the tests you carried out, you can pretty much acknowledge certain findings as fact. That's sort of the process people like Rutherford used to determine the atomic model. \n\nAs for being able to see it, I don't think so. We have two types of microscope - Light microscope and Electron microscope. LM uses lightwaves (duh) and so objects too small to interfere with these waves cannot be seen. EM uses electrons (of course), which which are very tiny, and they bounce back of the object at different angles to give us awesome 3d images. I don't need to tell you what would happen if we tried to fire electrons at an atom... but that's beside the point. The Rutherford experiments already did that, and it told us that materials are mostly empty space and there is much distance between the nucleus and an electron. So, you can't see the \"model\" of the atom, but you can see individual atoms using an TEM transmission electron microscope iirc.",

I understand the concept of basically just avoiding any product that has gluten in it, but what are the benefits of doing this?  \n\nI know I have a friend who's actually allergic to gluten, and she can't eat a lot of stuff that I eat by the dump truck load because of it.  But why exactly do people go on specifically gluten free diets?",
        "answer": "The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise. Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.\n\nAnother school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.\n\nOf course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.",

It's nice when it's room temperature, below that, or maybe a little above.  It's because your body is constantly trying to keep your body at a relatively regular temperature.  This temperature varies across your body but we commonly accept that it's around 98.5 degrees.\n\nNow when you're cold, your body has a very efficient way of keeping that temperature up; it burns calories.  However our method of cooling down when we're too warm is less efficient, we sweat.\n\nSo, if the temperature in your bathroom is 70 degrees, your body is warming constantly.  It's very efficient at this, but to then be thrust into a warm shower that's only a few degrees above our body temperature, it's like... wow now i don't have to work so hard!  On top of this, you're not actually getting 100 degrees most likely.  Most water heaters are set to around 110, but it cools quite a few degrees as it gets to the shower head.  Plus then on top of that you're not getting that on your entire body at once, you're getting sprayed across maybe 1/4th of your body.  Plus you can spin in place, duck your head, step forwards or backwards, etc all to direct that glorious warm water wherever you want.  Then when you start to get too warm, you turn and guess what happens?  That's right, similar to sweating the water runs down your body or evaporates off, carrying heat away from that spot.\n\nNow, lets compare it to being in a room that's 100 degrees.  First of all, there's no break.  You can't turn and avoid the heat, it surrounds you.  It's why people put fans on themselves, to generate airflow to encourage evaporation of sweat from skin.  Plus there's a further issue at play here.  A lot of times when it's 100 degrees, it's also humid.  The more humid the environment, the less effective your sweating is at cooling you.\n\nEver hear someone say \"yeah, it's 100 degrees out, but it's a dry heat!\" as if that matters?  Well, it does!  A lower humidity means your body can cool itself more efficiently.\n\nAnyways, hope that helps.",

        "answer": "The term \"folding\" simply refers to how proteins react when they touch each other.\n\nFor example, Mad Cow Disease is caused when proteins start 'folding' incorrectly. A more prominent example is Alzheimers. We know a *little bit* about how proteins fold, but - in the scheme of things - there's much more that we *don't* know, and so we're not very good at controllling them or stopping them from going wrong.\n\nThe \"Fold@home\" program allows you to sign up to a mass network of computers that are all *simulating* this process, and figuring out what does/doesn't work. If scientists tried to do all of this work by hand, or just using the computers in their lab, it would take forever. By taking advantage of 'distributed computing' (i.e.: thousands of computers around the world), we can get it done much faster.\n\nNote: when your computer 'finishes' a work unit, this doesn't mean it has 'solved' the protein. Your little packet might only be a *thousandth* of the total workload. So - to the end user - it can seem like a very slow, very boring process. And it kind of is.\n\nBut - when all this data is pulled together - it creates an amazing database. Eventually, we might have enough data to start creating effective and long-lasting treatments for some conditions. In time, we may even be able to *cure* diseases completely (we already have some really exciting leads, but putting that theory into practice is another matter). It's not going to happen overnight, but your contribution is an important part of the process.",

So, usually the middle or last week of December, films that studios and distributors know are likely to win are released in those two markets to qualify for being released in, say 2014.\n\nBut, that's also a big time for big-budget blockbusters with the Christmas Season and winter breaks.  Since these films tend to be more artsy or dramatic, they can't compete in the wide release market.  So, they're held by the studios for a January-February wide release the following year, just in time to increase their buzz when the nominations are announced and drive more business to the theaters in the first couple of weeks.  This is important for financial reasons:\n\nThe first couple of weeks of wide release is when, contractually, the distributors reclaim from the theaters the bulk of the ticket sales prices, whereas limited releases are negotiated and treated separately, and don't affect the general trendlines for a wide release.  What you don't want is next to no ticket sales the first two weeks of wide and a big spike on the third because they go from getting about 95% of ticket sales week 1, 80% week 2 to about 50% week three, 25% week 4, etc.  The longer the film is in theaters, the less money the distributor makes from the ticket sales and the more that returns to the theater owners.",

Like if you put a blob of it out in the sun on a dinner plate it would convert.\n\nYou sort of ooze out cholesterol, and then it gets converted into \"vitamin D lotion\", that soaks back into your skin.\n\nSo there are some surprising things here to \"Get Vitamin-D from the sun\":\n\n- Depending on where you live, you may only be able to make significant quantities around noon (or 1pm on Daylight savings time) because that's the only time of the day that enough UV-B can get through the sky. The further towards the poles you get the smaller the window.\n\n- If you shower or bathe too soon before you sunbathe (like six hours) you can wash away most of the Cholesterol and there is nothing to convert.\n\n- If you shower or bathe too soon after you sunbathe (like eight hours) you can wash away the \"Vitamin-D lotion\" before it really soaks back into your skin.\n\n- It is very easy to get sunburnt without really getting any Vitamin-D in your system at all.\n\nSo basically most people get little or no value from going out in the sun because they don't do it near-enough noon or they are too clean.\n\nThe wikipedia page for Vitamin D discusses the particular form of cholesterol and how it all happens and looks like a good place to start if you want to know more.",

It doesn't matter what temperatures occurred in between, if you had added more heat than left, the house would be hotter in the morning, and if you added less heat than left, the house would be colder.\n\nThe thing that makes you right is that your house loses less energy when the difference between the inside temperature and the outside temperature is smaller.  Hot things transfer heat to cold things more quickly than warm things transfer heat to cold things, and two things that are the same temperature don't transfer heat between them at all.  Thus, if the temperature of the house in between the times we care about is lower, less heat is lost, so you use less heat overall.\n\nNow, this might not be true if there are special circumstances.  In some places, for instance, the cost of electricity varies by the demand, which means that electricity in the middle of the night could be cheaper than in the morning.  If your heating is electric in that case, it might be cheaper to heat the house at night due to the lower cost.  Other weird cases can come up as well.\n\nNote that I'm assuming you don't live somewhere that it freezes at night.

If you owe more money than the car is worth and you get into an accident you'll be given less money by your insurance provider than would be required to pay off your loan.\n\nGap insurance is insurance that will pay the difference between what you owe and what the car is worth in the event that the car is totaled and you owe more on the vehicle than it is worth. In this way you won't have to pay out of pocket to finish paying off a totaled car.\n\nGenerally speaking it's a bad idea to ever owe more on a vehicle than it is worth. Your down payment should be enough to cover the difference or you should purchase a more affordable vehicle.\n\nThe reason this can happen is fairly simple. When you purchase a vehicle with a loan the car ends up being more expensive than the negotiated price because there is interest on the loan. Once you take the car off the lot it's worth ~20% less and on top of that you likely have a ~1-10% interest rate on your loan. If you take the car off the lot and instantly get into a car accident totaling the vehicle your insurance company will give you the dollar amount for what the vehicle is worth used.

This crystal takes the 808nm infrared light and lases at 1064nm (yes, deeper in the infrared!). This 1064nm laser light comes out of the NdYV04 (neodymium yttrium vanadium oxide) crystal and is then shot into a second crystal (containing potassium, titanium,  & amp; phosphorus, usually called KTP) that doubles the frequency to 532nm - the bright green color you see.

Why is that?  \n\nIs the technology used by other nuclear-nations not capable of being replicated by others?",
        "answer": "They're just inherently hard to build. *How* hard depends on what we're talking about, but even the simplest nuclear bomb isn't something you could cook up in your basement.\n\nTo start with, you need *fissile material.* That's either highly refined uranium, or even more highly refined plutonium. Refining uranium to the point where it's useful in a bomb is *incredibly* hard, in no small part because uranium hexafluoride \u2014\u00a0the chemical compound you actually have to do the refining to \u2014\u00a0is one of the most corrosive things around. Refining plutonium is even harder, because it requires a *nuclear reactor* to do it.\n\nThen, once you've got the fissile material, you have to build a bomb around it. You can't just duct tape it to a stick of dynamite or a block of semtex; you have to build a *very special kind* of bomb to *very tight* engineering tolerances. Get that wrong and the bomb will still go off, but you won't get a nuclear explosion. You'll get a regular old explosion that sprays toxic fissile material around. (Which may be all you're after if you're a crazy person looking to make trouble, but to anybody who's not in that category, that's an unqualified failure.)\n\nThen there's the question of how you deliver the bomb you've built \u2026\u00a0assuming you got that far. See, it's *relatively* easy to build a huge, heavy atomic bomb. (\"Relatively easy\" here meaning \"still incredibly hard, just not as hard as the other stuff we're about to talk about.\") But huge, heavy atomic bombs are, well, *huge* and *heavy!* They can only be delivered by planes, and *gigantic and slow* planes at that. That worked out okay a couple times in the 40s, but that's at play you really only get to run once, because it's trivially easy to defend against if the other guy's even remotely paying attention.\n\nSo instead, the idea is to stick your atomic bomb on top of a rocket. Unlike gigantic, slow planes, rockets are *really* hard to defend against \u2026 but you can't stick a huge, heavy bomb on top of a rocket. To use a rocket to deliver your bomb, you need your bomb to be very small and lightweight. Think large-dog sized, rather than herd-of-elephants sized.\n\nAnd building an atomic bomb that's small and lightweight is *much* harder than building a big, heavy one. Remember when I said the engineering tolerances for a nuclear bomb are very strict? The engineering tolerances for a *missile warhead* are far *more* strict. Because not only do you have to do everything you've already done backwards and in heels, as they say, you have to do it in such a way that the thing can be *shot into space on top of a rocket* and still work when it comes back down!\n\nSo the bottom line is \u2026\u00a0it's hard. It's just an inherently difficult thing to do. It's not *impossible,* clearly, as many people have done it over the years. But it's very difficult nevertheless.",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "The solar system is broadly speaking split into 5 distinct parts or layers, and all have their origins in how we believe stars form in the first place.\n\nGalaxies are full of dust and debris left over from gigantic star supernova that happened millions or billions of years ago. Sometimes that dust gets excited and begins to clump together. Seeing as the vast majority of the material is Hydrogen and Helium, the central clump eventually becomes a Star. Once enough Hydrogen and Helium condenses into a point, the star 'Ignites' and begins undergoing fusion, this is the first layer of our star system.\n\nOnce the star 'Ignites' there is still a fairly large amount of material left over, most of it is still gas but there's a lot of Oxygen, Silicon, Aluminium, Iron etc. left around as well. This material is also condensing in towards the new star, and because of the way angular momentum works this material ends up forming a large flat disk. However the star is very hot, and is throwing off a strong 'solar wind' (charged particles streaming out from the star). These two factors combine to push away most of the remaining lighter elements (Hydrogen and Helium) that were left over. Over time the only material left near the star itself is made up of heavier elements, which then themselves that condensing into objects. This is how we believe the inner rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) formed. This is the second layer.\n\nThe third layer is the asteroid belt, which is roughly speaking the boundary between the inner and outer planets. There are a few theories as to why this belt exists where it does, one of the leading theories is that it contains the same rocky material that formed the inner planets but never condensed into an actual planet because of the intense gravity from Jupiter messing it up.\n\nThe Fourth layer is the outer gas giants. Remember earlier I said heat and solar wind blasted away a lot of the lighter Hydrogen and Helium material? This is where it ended up. All that leftover gas and other trace materials ended up condensing into the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and their respective moons.\n\nThe fifth and final layer is the Kuiper belt and by extension the Oort cloud at the edges of our star system. These areas are home to Pluto and many other dwarf planets, and other icy and rocky materials. This material was too far away to be pulled inwards into the rocky planets but still close enough to be caught in the Sun's overall gravity, albeit on millenia long orbits.",

        "answer": "The fact that the air is moving is not what does the cooling.  \n\nMoving air can be hot. Firemen wear masks precisely because superheated air moving through their lungs would scald them so badly that they'd die gasping.  Less dramatically, open the window of an air-conditioned room on a hot day in Texas, and the moving air will heat you up pretty quickly.\n\nThe reason that \"moving air\" tends to cool things off is because most of the time, what you're doing is moving air that is already hot away from the source of the heat and replacing it with cooler air.  So, for instance, when you blow on some soup, what you're doing is speeding up the process where the air that is close to the soup---and thus close to the same temperature as the soup---gets replaced by the cooler surrounding air.  This lets the soup dump heat into the new air fast (since it starts cooler) and cools the soup. \n\nA similar thing happens with a fan.  When it blows on you, it's moving air away that your body has already transferred heat to, replacing that with new air.  Even if that new air is warm, it's likely to be less humid (since your sweat hasn't evaporated into it yet) which will allow your body to more efficiently cool itself.\n\nAnd, yes, all that movement does create heat through friction, but at the speeds you're going to encounter in your life, the friction of those air molecules is dwarfed by these other effects.",

Pizza can be a countable noun (one pizza, two pizzas, three pizzas), but as you showed in your final usage, it can also be an uncountable noun when being used to discuss the *concept* of pizza.\n\nBurgers don't exist in that same conceptual, uncountable space.

So for your final burger example, you could again \"fix\" it by saying *A burger is my favorite food.*\n\nIt should be noted that although **burger** is always a count noun, **hamburger** can be both. A hamburger can be a single, discrete unit (a meat patty between a bun), but it can also refer to the ground round that makes it up in a more general sense. So *My favorite food is hamburger* probably doesn't sound as weird, and certainly *hamburger is my favorite food* sounds better.\n\nThe distinction between count nouns and uncountable nouns is definitely a hard one for non-native speakers, and something most have to spend quite a bit of time mastering.\n\nOther uncountable food nouns that would work in your sentence would be: pasta, rice, soup, honey, bread, and meat.\n\n**Don't worry, it's not random.** If you look at all of these things, you'll notice that there's something they all have in common: you can't easily separate them into a single part. That's why we call them uncountable. A burger is a thing \u2013 it's a piece of meat between two slices of bread. We can lay five burgers out in front of us and count that there are five. A sandwich is a thing \u2013 same concept. Oranges are countable things.\n\nBut while *a pizza* is a countable thing, when you are talking about pizza as a whole, it becomes pretty uncountable. Same with pouring a bag of rice on the table. Or bread. So we attach a unit of measurement to them if we want to turn them into a countable noun \u2013 a slice of pizza, a grain of rice, a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, a spoon of honey. At that point they become a countable noun, and we'd use the same rules \u2013 *My favorite thing to eat is a slice of pizza* not *My favorite thing to eat is slice of pizza*.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n**tl;dr** Pizza belongs to a group of nouns called 'uncountable nouns' that don't take an article (a/an/the), whereas burger is a 'count noun' which needs the article to exist (so you can have *a burger* or *five burgers*). Pizza is especially confusing because it can be used in both ways (*I want pizza* or *I want a pizza*). The easiest way to figure out if something is countable or uncountable is to see if you could easily count specific items. You can count individual pizza pies, which is why we use pizza as countable when we say pizzas. But pizza is generally a group food, and if you were to imagine having a pizza in front of you, and trying to share it among friends by telling them how much they get (without adding a unit like 'slice' by slicing it up), you couldn't easily do that. If you had a group of burgers, though, you could easily say 'you get two burgers', 'you get three', etc. It's countable.",

The street credential is in putting the damaging tag in a visible location that remains up for an extended length of time. A quick search of Google news shows reports about taggers who fell to their death or fell to extreme injury while trying to tag in dangerous places without appropriate safety gear. Many of them are taking risks, perhaps freecliming or occasionally using a simple climbing harness, to put their vandalism on the wall.\n\nWe had some high rise buildings tagged quite high a few years back.

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "(Actual law enforcement officer)\n\nTL;DR - There are several methods to prove impairment.\n\nIn the US, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has standards when it comes to detecting/proving when a driver is impaired. Deviation from those standards could potentially result in the loss of conviction of a DUI case. Deviation doesn't guarantee the case will be tossed because it really comes down to how hard the DAs/Judges want to push the charge. DUI cases typically get plead down if the defense attorney is a DUI whiz and can articulate when and how the officer deviated from the NTHSA standards. For example, if I don't explain a certain roadside test \"correctly\" the case may be tossed.\n\nFirst, I'll run the driver through the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. This is where they watch the stimulus (pen, finger, etc) move side to side which gives me the chance to look for a rhythmic bouncing of the eyes. The higher the blood alcohol concentration, the more noticeable the bouncing is. By the end of this test I almost always know whether or not the driver is DUI. At this point I'll already have noticed slurred speech or the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming off their breath or from inside the vehicle. Things that I can articulate which will contribute to my case of the driver's impairment. \n\nThe next two tests I perform are pretty much for the camera, in order to gain further evidence of impairment. The Walk and Turn, and One Leg Stand test will each demonstrate the driver's lack of coordination and balance. Some officers I know will have the person count a range of numbers, series of letters, or have them touch fingers to nose. They aren't incorrect, but they just aren't my personal style.\n\nLast thing I have them do on the roadside is blow into the Portable Breath Tester (aka \"Breathalyzer\"). This will confirm my suspicions of impairment from the HGN test I first performed. The PBT result is not admissible in court as evidence which I why we run them through the official breath tester at the jail or police station. That machine will produce an official, court-admissible BAC result.",

Holding a pencil and writing out 124 + 139 = 263 is a _vastly_ more difficult problem than solving the equation, but most people could accomplish the writing without \"thinking\", while the math problem takes some thought, since the motor-control and visual recognition are things the brain is primed to do, unlike addition.\n\nThis threw a lot of early AI researchers, who originally expected things like machine vision to be easily solved on the way to conquering big problems like chess and advanced math.

        "answer": "\"Moneyball\" is simply about finding undervalued assets.  When the book was written, Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics happened to be focusing on stats because they had discovered that teams were overvaluing certain stats, such as runs batted in (which a player has a very limited amount of control over).  They discovered that teams weren't focused on more important stats, such as on base percentage, so they targeted low cost players who weren't properly valued in that regard.  They basically approached with a business mentality out of necessity.  They didn't have the money to spend that the Yankees and other teams did, so they had to find players who provided the most production at the lowest cost.",

The US and EU supply a lot of well engineered products for industry and construction. Caterpillar is one example of a company that has seen sales crater because of the construction slowdown.

Communists were painted as evil and, appealing to the supermajority of devout Christians in America at the time, as atheists without a sense of morality. Some major political figures sought to increase contrast between the democracy and their communist enemies by intwining religion into the U.S. currency and into the Pledge of Allegiance.

While it's in session, debates and hearings can be scheduled for any time, though the number of MPs that turn up depends on what's happening - most will attend a debate about an important bill, or Prime Minister's questions (on Wednesdays), but few will attend more minor things.\n\n >  What is the significants of votes they pass? Who can submit bills? \n\nThey vote to pass bills into law. If something passes the vote in the House of Commons then it is sent to the House of Lords. If it passes the vote there then the queen signs off on it and it becomes law. If the Lords reject it then it goes back to the commons and they can change it and try again or ditch it. Any member can submit a bill. It gets three readings and a vote before being sent to the Lords. In the Lords it gets another three readings and a vote before going to the queen.\n\n >  What is the significance of the political parties? What does it matter if somebody is the MP for such and such?\n\nBasically, Labour party is more left-wing (like the US Democrats), Conservatives are more right-wing (like the Republicans) and the Liberal Democrats are somewhere in the middle, but a bit to the left. There are some smaller parties too, mainly nationalist ones from the other countries of the UK, like the SNP (Scotland) and Plaid Cymru (Wales). The MPs are supposed to represent their constituency (which can be a town, or a region of a city) so if I live in Liverpool and think the government should be doing something about our motorway, I can speak to my MP and he can raise the issue in parliament. They are also supposed to represent the feelings of their constituents. If an MPs constituency is largely anti fox hunting, for example, then that should have an impact on whether he votes to ban it or not.\n\nEach constituency elects one MP. If a party has over a certain number of MPs then they automatically form the government and their leader is Prime Minister. If no party reaches that number, then parties have to form a coalition to get a majority and form a government (at the moment there is a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats).\n\n >  Whats the deal with the budget and the economy?\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer (an MP chosen by the Prime Minister, basically) decides the budget each year. This is presented to Parliament as a bill.\n\n >  What are the important decisions that are made and all that jazz?\n\nWell, pretty much the same as the parliament/congress of any other country. They decide on laws, budget and foreign policy. Some lesser powers are devolved to local councils (local taxes, transport, schooling, refuse collection, etc.) and to the parliaments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

But our history books make no mention anything north of Maine. So ELI5, how did Canada get settled by Europeans and how did they end up independent of the British?",
        "answer": "Technically, we are 'constitutionally independent', but we are not a republic. Technically, we are a 'Dominion'.\n\nThis means we are self-governing and can make up our own minds regarding national and international issues and how we involve ourselves. Prior to this, we basically had to do whatever the crown told us. (ie. Go to War.) It also often made Canadians second-class citizens in the eyes of the English (ie. 'from the Colonies').\n\nCurrently, our Head of State is the Queen (or Reigning Monarch), represented by a Governor-General, and his/her Lieutenant (Pronounced 'Leftenant') Governors, one for each Province/Territory. The GG's role is... nominal at best, but is maintained for the sake of show and tradition. In reality we are government by Federal Provincial and Municipal (where there are some) governments. The head of the Federal Government is the Prime Minister, who is elected from within whichever party has the most seats (not always the majority of seats, though presently, the current government is made up of a Conservative Majority). The provincial governments are similar, with both federal and provincial govts. made up of multiple parties which generally boil down to: Liberals, Conservatives, NDP (Moderates... ish), Greens, and Bloc Quebecois (think ethno-centrists whose platform is largely based on separation of Quebec and Canada). Provincial heads of government are 'Premiers'. \nMunicipal governments are based on towns, counties or both, depending on how the province is broken down.\nFederal law trumps Provincial which trumps Municipal. We elect our government by party, not leader (though its often pretty clear who the leader is going to be), and seem to do it very frequently. \n\nThat said, we are still a commonwealth country and enjoy certain benefits and relationships as a result. \n\nAs for the broader history of Canada, its a rich tapestry woven from many different cultures, though predominantly the Scottish, English and French (see Quebecois and Acadian, for a start), as well as, obviously, many, many Native ethnicities. Much of Canada was opened up by the fur trade, and the associated industries that sprang off them. Wiki The North West Company and/or the Hudson's Bay Company (they eventually merged) - The HBC is the world's oldest corporation, and at one time basically owned the majority of Canada. Their industry essentially recruited natives to provide animal furs in exchange (often at outrageous and exploitative rates) for Western and/or manufactured goods like linen, knives, axes, tools, guns, sugar, flour, etc.\nWestern explorers also pushed back the boundaries of the frontier by exploring Canada via waterways; travelling in the native fashion with canoes and portaging where they could not. \n\nEventually this was fleshed out completely by the railroad, which ultimately spanned Canada East to West, and opened up additional resources, such as timber, Gold (and other minerals) and linked the two sides of Canada. Traditionally, this railroad and its many, many assets were owned by Canada Pacific Railway, which, like the HBC, is now, sadly, a shadow of its former glory, though that glory can still be seen in the hotels they erected along the way, such as Chateau Lac Louise in Alberta, the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa, and a few others I dont remember.\n\nIn terms of military history, Canada has an excellent war museum, in Ottawa, which is worth visiting and sums it up nicely. In brief, Canadian warfare has (chronologically) included a variety of conflicts with the natives, the French - who had originally colonized much of Canada but were essentially kicked out by the British, especially at such battles as the Plains of Abraham and Louisbourg. Many of the French were exiled back to France (despite being multiple-generation 'Canadians'.) others were resettled, giving rise to pocket communities like the Acadians in Nova Scotia. Canadians also fought in a variety of other international wars, including in Russia during the revolution there (though IIRC they didnt do too much), the Boer War in South Africa, WW1 and WW2. In WW1 they accomplished incredible things at terrible costs; more Canadians died in WWI than WWII. For highlights, look up Vimy Ridge (an entrenched fortification held by the Germans that had held off (and slaughtered) everyone else for years, that the Canadians essentially took in a day, by using their heads), Passchendaele and many, many others. \n\nIn WWII Canadians fought alongside the British from the outset, in Africa, and later in Italy, France and Holland - which they later liberated. Most Americans have heard of the Normandy landings; what most dont know is that the landings took place on five separate beachheads. The Americans took one two(Omaha and Utah) the British, with the Free French, took two (Sword and Gold), and the Canadians took the Fifth (Juno) and most heavily defended. \n\nWe also burned down the White House once. \n\n**edit1 - adding more detail**",

I'm not well versed in African and European history, so please keep that in mind.",
        "answer": "There's a very approachable book which discusses Africa's recent history: [The Fate of Africa](_URL_0_) by Martin Meredith.  \n\nBefore the 19th century rush to colonize Africa, some parts of it were relatively well off (notably west Africa, with empires like Songhai and Mali and advanced city-states like Hausa or Timbuktu) and others were still fairly isolated and primitive (most of eastern sub-Saharan Africa).  There are various theories as to why - one common but controversial theory is that Africa's north-south geography limited the plants, animals and diseases that could spread in its climates (it varies from European temperate in South Africa to jungle to desert to Mediterranean in Algeria and Morocco), so it failed to make the most of its natural resources until explorers such as the Polynesians brought crops that had high yields.  Others have suggested that tsetse flies made it hard to spread domesticated animals to sub-Saharan Africa, or that jungle soil is particularly bad for growing crops, or that they were simply unluckily late in adopting gunpowder and that European imperialism retarded the growth of democracy and modern infrastructure in the continent by 50+ years.  \n\nIt's probably too facile to argue that imperialism caused all of Africa's problems, but there's some truth to it: all three countries you mention suffered problems because of it.  In general, when Europe left its colonies, it drew nice, straight lines on the map that rarely conformed to ethnic or religious divisions.  Rwanda is a country with two very distinct, very different ethnic groups forced to live together in a small country - a recipe which Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia found abhorrent.  Liberia was created by the U.S.A. as a place to send freed slaves to in order to get them out of the U.S. and \"back\" to their homeland - no matter that there were already people living there who spoke no English and were not Christians, no matter that the blacks they were shipping there were not used to the climate, the plants or animals of the region...is it any wonder they had ethnic problems?",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "**Hub:** Hubs are dumb. They are basically just multi-port repeaters. Any electrical signature the hub receives on one port is sent out all the other ports. They are cheap and easy to set-up since there is no configuring. However, since all traffic is multiplied and repeated, it can lead to congestion of bandwidth and, depending on how many are used and how they are connected, infinite loops that kill your network.\n\n**Switches:** Switches are a little smarter. Those electric signals are simply electrical representations of 1's and 0's, forming binary numbers. What those binary numbers mean depends on an agreed upon protocol. Most switched networks today use ethernet. Under this scheme, all network ports have what is known as a MAC Address - a (relatively) unique identifier. When sending messages across the network, the source and destination MAC addresses are included. Switches can read these addresses. As it observes the traffic passing through its ports, it keeps track of which source MAC addresses it sees on which ports, storing this information in a table. When it sees a message for a specific destination MAC address, it references its table to see what port it should be sent down, and sends the message out that port only (unlike the Hub which blindly sends traffic out all of its ports). If it has no entry for a given destination, it sends out a broadcast, which means it ends up sending it out all ports like a Hub would, but then keeps note of any responses so it can add them to its table and know which port to send it out in the future.\n\n**Routers:** Routers are even smarter. Within the ethernet frames (handled by switches above) is additional information most likely using the Internet Protocol (IP). This is where the term IP address comes from. IP addresses (along with other information) groups computers into networks, and allows computers to distinguish between \"local\" and \"remote\" computers. If a destination computer is \"local\" (on the same network), then MAC addresses are enough to communicate, using only switches. However, if it is not local (on a different network), then routers are necessary. The traffic is sent to the router (often via a switch) and the router, like a switch, has tables. Whereas a switch has tables for individual mac addresses assigned to ports, routers assign entire networks to ports, meaning its tables are simpler than those of a switch. Additionally, most routers have \"default gateways\" which designates a port to send traffic it doesn't have information for, meaning it doesn't need to use broadcast. Routers also communicate with each other to dynamically update their routing tables to reflect the best way to route information among themselves.",

The amount of energy is the same for each photon the solar panel captures, in the case of silicon 1.1 eV (a unit for very small amounts of energy) per photon. If the photon has less than 1.1 eV, all its energy is turned into useless heat, and if it has more than 1.1 eV, the excess energy is turned into heat. This creates a hard limit for the amount of energy that can be capture by a solar panel, around 33%.\n\nThird generation solar panels is a term for a whole bunch of different technologies which try to use materials other than silicon in order to surpass this limit. One approach for example is to use multiple layers made of different materials, each of which is optimized for a different wavelength of light. This allows photons with less energy to be captured, and at the same time make better use of the photons with more energy.",

        "answer": "Let's say your job is to grow corn. You recognize that other people want corn and so you go to your neighbor who has carrots and offer a trade. One ear of corn for five carrots. You continue this for a few months, trading corn for carrots every week. \n\nWell, the carrot guy has a bad year, so he can't give you 5 carrots per corn anymore. But he still wants corn to feed his family. He gives you four carrots and writes \"1 carrot\" on a piece of paper and gives it to you with the promise being that at a later time, you can trade that piece of paper for a carrot.\n\nOver time, you accrue a handful of carrot slips. The pea trader comes along and wants to trade 1 pound of peas for every two ears of corn. You can't afford to give him two ears of corn, so you give him one ear and write \"1 corn\" on a slip of paper and hand it to him.\n\nYou've now essentially set up a currency. Carrots are worth 1 slip of carrot paper, ears of corn are worth 5 slips of carrot paper or 1 slip of corn paper, and a pound of peas is worth 10 slips of carrot paper or 2 slips of corn paper. \n\nThe three of you agree that the slip system is a good idea. However, it has problems--namely that you've got multiple slips of paper (corn, peas, carrots) that each hold a different value. You also think it should be expanded to allow you to trade other things like horses, hay, clothing, metal, etc. Maintaining the slip system becomes very difficult when you start giving every commodity its own slip. You realize it would work better if the slips were abstract--make it so they have no value themselves other than what you agree upon.\n\nYou decide to give the currency a name--the dollar (or the peso/franc/pound/etc.). Using the existing ratios of trade that you've established, the prices become 1 dollar = 1 carrot, 5 dollars = 1 corn, and 10 dollars = 1 pound of peas. You no longer have to do trades in terms of \"this much corn for this much peas\". If two of you agree that one hour of farm work would normally be worth 5 ears of corn, you--you can pay them 25 dollars instead. They can then use these 25 dollars to buy whatever they want (corn or otherwise).\n\nThe benefit here is that, normally, if you got paid in corn, you'd have to find someone who wanted corn to make a trade. You just finished your hour of work and decide you want to buy a shirt, but nobody who sold shirts wants your 5 corn. By getting paid in dollars instead of corn, you can now go buy that shirt you wanted because the person selling the shirt can use those dollars to buy thread, needles, cloth, food, transportation, etc., from people who also agree that those dollars have value, and so on and so forth.\n\nTl;dr: Money gets its value from people agreeing that it has value and that you can trade (almost) anything for the right amount of money.",

        "answer": "Okay... hang tight, this is going to be a little bit of a long story.\n\nFirst, let's get some terminology out of the way:\n\n* AT (Absolute Terror/Territory) Field: a psychically-generated barrier. Life on earth can normally only generate a powerful enough AT field to become solid and separate from all other creatures. Angels and Evangelions are capable of projecting much stronger AT fields that can have physical effects on the world.\n* Angel: A seed of life or any species created by one (this include human life)\n* Contact Experiment: Any situation in which a human is deliberately merged with a Seed of Life, Evangelion, or Angel.\n* Evangelion: An artificial angel made by cloning a Seed of Life.\n* LCL: The stuff that looks like Tang. It is actually the primordial soup from which life both arises and is composed of, and the Seeds of Life generate it like blood.\n* Seed of Life: Adam or Lilith, for the purposes of this conversation.\n\nBillions of years ago there was a species called the First Ancestral Race that was in decline. They wanted to leave behind some kind of permanent mark on the galaxy for when they were gone, so they created Seeds of Life, beings in their own image who would be sent to different planets and create living things, and sent them in artificial moons to many planets. \n\nSome of the Seeds of Life carried the information to provide their worlds with the Fruit of Life. This meant that each life-form created would be completely unique, a species unto itself, but that it would have unlimited energy (like the Angels). Other Seeds of Life contained the Fruit of Knowledge, which meant that they would create species of multiple individuals that had finite energy and lifespans, but could reproduce among themselves, evolve, and develop the intelligence to produce civilization and technology (like life as we know it basically). All of the seeds were sent out in a moon along with Dead Sea Scrolls, which were records of what the Seeds of Life are and how they worked (basically like a technical manual), and also a Spear of Longinus, which was a device designed to be used by the Seed of Life to help shape their world, but also to deactivate them if something went wrong.\n\nOn Earth, something went wrong. Adam was the Seed of Life the First Ancestral Race intended for Earth, but Lilith's moon somehow got knocked off course and ended up on earth as well. During the crash, Lilith's spear was destroyed, so Adam's spear shut Adam off. Lilith then seeded the earth with life. This event was called the First Impact. The Moon containing Adam was embedded under the surface of Antarctica. Part of the Moon containing Lilith was embedded under the surface of Japan, but its outer shell was thrown into space and eventually became the moon we have today.\n\nSometime after World War II, an organization called SEELE discovered Lilith's body along with her Dead Sea Scrolls. SEELE interpreted the Scrolls and concluded that a being with both the Fruit of Knowledge and the Fruit of Life would be essentially all-powerful and immortal. SEELE intended that this being should house their consciousnesses. In order to house all of them, the separation between individual humans would have to be erased-- SEELE may or may not have intended for this to only happen to them, or else to all of humanity. This is the Human Instrumentality Project. Basically everything from this point on is their attempt to fulfill the project, except for the things which were attempts by others to hijack the project for their own goals. The existence of the First Ancestral Race and the Seeds of Life was kept secret from everyone except NERV.\n\nThe first step in SEELE's plan was to wake up Adam, then use the Spear of Longinus to regress him into a fetal state. The Katsuragi expedition, led by Misato's family, was chosen to fulfill this step of the plan. When Adam was awakened, the first thing it did was start breaking down the AT fields of life on earth, causing a major cataclysm that killed a third of the world's population instantly, with another billion dying in wars or starving as a result. This was Second Impact, which SEELE covered up as being the result of a meteor strike in Antarctica. \n\nPart of the Katsuragi expedition involved a contact experiment in which human DNA was merged with Adam. At the site of Second Impact, three living things were recovered: Misato (who had been put in a capsule by her father to protect her), the now-embryonic and weakened Adam, and Kaworu, who was the result of Adam merging with human DNA (donor unknown). SEELE recovered Adam's soul and put it into Kaworu. All according to plan so far for SEELE.\n\nSEELE had been experimenting with cloning Lilith for a while, creating Evangelions, which would be necessary to house their consciousness at the fulfillment of the Instrumentality Project. They also knew that Adam would produce a number of angels while he was awake to try to recover him so that he could finish nullifying the AT fields of all life on Earth and go back to fulfilling his program to seed the earth with Angels, so they needed the Evangelions to kill those angels before they could reach Adam or Lilith (who if an Angel merged with her would have done about the same thing), and also to provide them with a Fruit of Life to put in one of the Evas. Eva-01 was created from Lilith with the intent of being used as SEELE's/humanity's new body, the rest were created from Adam.\n\nGendo and Yui Ikari, Shinji's parents, were members of SEELE. However after Shinji was born, Yui decided she could not go through with the Human Instrumentality Project if success came at his expense. Therefore she initiated a second Contact Experiment with Unit-01, merging her soul with its body in order to protect him-- this is what happens when Unit-01 goes berserk, she's in there fighting for her son's life. Her ultimate intention was to make sure that if any consciousness was in charge of Instrumentality, it would be Shinji's. Seemingly losing his wife drove Gendo insane and made him decide to deviate from the project in a way that would put him in charge of Instrumentality so that he could bring Yui back. He needed an alternative Kaworu that would be loyal to him, so he created Rei from Yui's DNA combining with Lilith and her soul.\n\nHowever Gendo didn't anticipate that his plan was running contrary to Yui-as-unit-01's, or that both Rei and Kaworu would love Shinji and judge him as being the one to control Humanity's destiny after Instrumentality ahead of Gendo.",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "As of May 2013, neither is recognized in the DSM-V (Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition). Asperger's, clinically speaking, no longer exists as of the 5th edition and now simply falls under the umbrella of ASD. High-Functioning Autism (HFA) and Asperger's are often used to describe the same degree of impairment (or rather the lack thereof compared to others when looking at the bell-curve of impairment), even though neither term is recognized in the DSM-V. ASD is measured on a 3 level scale; Level 1 being \"needing support\", Level 2 is \"requiring substantial support\", and Level 3 is \"requiring very substantial support\". \n\nHowever, some people who would have been diagnosed with Asperger's in the past, may now fall under a (newly-added to the DSM) condition called \"Social Communication Disorder (SCD); That being said, a diagnosis of SCD would only occur AFTER autism has been ruled out, as they would need to ensure other markers of autism are not present such as the presence of repetitive behaviours or restricted interests, and the impairment is specifically related to verbal/non verbal communication skills. This can be tricky because there are many overlapping symptoms between ASD and SCD so it is always important to involve a psychologist and an SLP (Speech Language Pathologist) to ensure all bases have been covered. \n\nWith all of that being said, Asperger's and HFA are still common nomenclature outside of a clinical setting, and many individuals who previously had this diagnosis prior to the DSM changes will still identify as having Asperger's or being in the class of HFA.",

        "question": "If space is a vacuum, how come it's so cold?",
        "question_ctx": "Wouldn't there have to be something there to be cold? What's making it cold?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, space isn't just space. How \"hot\" or \"cold\" it is depends on where you are. It also doesn't help that heat \"moves\" differently in space than it does on earth due to the vacuum.\n\nIf you have a thermometer in your house and take it outside, it will warm up or cool down until it reaches the same temperature as everything around it, with \"everything\" mainly being the atmosphere or whatever rock/table/bit of ground you left it lying on. By coming in contact the atmosphere and the ground, the thermometer can easily exchange heat with the environment and will soon give you an accurate reading of the temperature.\n\nNow let us imagine you're on the International Space Station and you do the same thing. You take your thermometer out of the ISS and leave it floating a little bit outside the airlock. Let's say you also did this \"at night\", i.e. when the ISS passes through earth's shadow so that the sun doesn't interfere with your experiment. The thermometer's temperature will barely change. This doesn't mean that the space is the same temperature as the inside of the ISS, it's just that your thermometer can't exchange heat the way it would on earth since it's in a vacuum. It will cool VERY SLOWLY by emitting so-called black body radiation (this is exactly the same as the light that metal gives off when it glows red hot, except that your thermometer is only at room temperature, so it only glows in the infra-red).\n\nNow let's say you wait a little longer. The orbit will carry the thermometer out of earth's shadow into full sunlight. Now, the thermometer is giving off a little bit of IR light (which cools it down slowly very slowly) and absorbs large amounts of light from the sun (which heats it up rapidly). This means that your thermometer floating in space will get HOTTER! And for quite a while, it will continue to get hotter and hotter. However, as it gets hotter, it will emit more and more black body radiation until the radiation it loses is equal to what it gains from the sun. At this point, it will be showing the \"correct\" temperature, which is quite hot for the ISS. After all, when you're in orbit around earth, you receive more light per square meter than if you were sitting in the Sahara desert at mid day.\n\nFinally, let's imagine that you did the same thing from a space ship that was floating in deep space (i.e. well outside of our galaxy). Now the thermometer will lose heat through black body radiation as it did before, but there is no sun to heat it up. The only light it can absorb is the so-called \"cosmic microwave background\", which is the left-over light from the big bang. But otherwise, the situation is the same. The thermometer will continue to lose temperature (and hence will emit less and less black-body radiation) until it is giving off as much as it is receiving from the CMB. This happens at about -270C, which is very cold indeed. This is why people say that space is cold, but it's really only true for deep space.",

A potential employer looks more favorably on resignation than termination. You're also in a decent negotiating position with your employer over the terms of your resignation. You can ask for something like severance pay much more effectively, because being asked to resign implies that you've screwed up, but not necessarily in an actual fireable way, so they'll be more pliant to keep things civil, which severance pay is a part of. \n\nIf you choose not to resign your boss will probably just fire you, which will be a red letter on a resume since employers almost always want to know why you left your previous job. Offering resignation is sort of the more polite and civil way of getting rid of an employee. However in the US it does also mean not getting unemployment benefits. Since you don't get those for quitting a job. \n\nIt IS more beneficial for you to be terminated in regards to short term finances, because you get unemployment benefits, but you also have the downside of having to say \"I was terminated from this job after I refused to resign\" in some form to people who may otherwise have offered you a job. Leaving your prior employer on good terms (resigning) makes them much better as a reference than if you put them in a position of having to fire you. Resignation is less dickish, which is something an employer will actually care about. They're not monsters generally, if they're letting you go it's because you've done something wrong or against policy, and they risk more by keeping you. Saying \"I expect your resignation tomorrow\" is their way of saying \"we're letting you go, but we can talk about how that happens\".

The heat also makes the fibers shrink up (by length and thickness) by squeezing the water out, which is why your burger patty gets smaller when you cook it.

        "answer": "and yet, /u/kateLowell and /u/kuttymongoose are wrong. from pure thermodynamic standpoint there could be temperature lower then absolute zero.\n\nfrom wikipedia (_URL_1_ ):\n\nMost familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their entropy. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state, so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.\n\nOn January 3, 2013, physicists announced that they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom for the first time.\n\nin more layman friendly terms:\n\nyou can't achieve negative temperatures (in Kelvin scale) in everyday world, but in some system you can lower entropy to create negative values of temperature. everytyhing is based on [this equation](_URL_0_)",

        "question_ctx": "This has always fascinated me, though it seems like a very heavy subject to get a grasp of",
        "answer": "It is a very heavy subject, and the workings of a modern encryption algorithm are beyond what ELI5 can do. \n\nBut the basic principles can be explained by looking at a very old and simple example, the **Caesar cipher**, which was reportedly used by Julius Caesar: you take the text you want to encrypt, and shift every letter by a fixed number (let's call it K) of letters in the alphabet. So if your number K is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, etc. and Z cycles over and becomes C. The message ATTACK is encrypted to DWWDFM. To decrypt, you simply shift the letters in the opposite direction.\n\nThe important detail here is that you can use *different* numbers K and in theory, everyone can know this method, and they still can't read the message unless they know the K you used. It's your **encryption key** and an essential principle of encryption is that **the encryption algorithm (method) does not have to be secret, only the key**. This makes it much more secure because you can do public research on the methods and implement it in software that is distributed to your agents and not have to worry that it will become worthless when the algorithm is leaked or reverse engineered from captured equipment. All you have to do is use a different key and you're good again.\n\nBack to the Caesar cipher: as you may have guessed, it's of course pretty useless because there are only 26 possible keys, so it's easy to try them all. Additonally, it's vulnerable to even the most trivial decyphering methods, like looking at the frequency of letters: if the text is English and long enough, you know that the most frequent letter is definitely E, and immediately you can compute the key.\n\nSo modern encryption uses **far more complex methods.** Matrix multiplications as described by /u/whatsausername90 are sometimes one part, but always combined with other methods, in order to make analysis impossible. For example the very common [AES](_URL_0_) cipher uses 4 different basic methods which are repeated up to 14 times using very carefully chosen constants to combine the input and intermediate the results with.\n\nNow all of this describes **secret-key encryption** - the key has to be exchanged securely and secretly in advance between the party doing the encryption and the one doing the decryption.\n\nNowadays, a lot of encryption is done with **public keys**, which sounds like a contradiction in terms. It's a fascination method developed in the 1970s. The basic idea is that you have both a public and a private key, and the public key can be well, public, allowing anyone to *encrypt* messages, but only if you know the private key you can *decrypt* the message. Sounds like magic, but it's math. The core is that the public and private keys are actually related, and you can easily compute the public key if you know the private one, but not vice versa because the computation is a **one-way function**: we know an efficient way to do it, but reversing it is much, much harder. The most common example is the multiplication of prime numbers. Any computer can multiply huge numbers in millionths of a second, but finding the prime factors of a huge number can take years, and if it's huge enough, practically forever.",

The short answer to this is because of a thing called [Rayleigh scattering](_URL_1_). The longer answer is covered in many ELI5 why is the sky blue posts.\n\nNext we need to note that the sun is white, everyone draws it yellow and I've heard a couple of explanations of this: it's hard to draw white on a white sheet of paper, the sun is yellow lower in the sky when we can see it. If you want to check for yourself, don't look at the sun. Instead get a white sheet of paper and shine a yellow light on it inside, what colour does it look (Yellow)? Then go outside what colour now (white)?\nAs others explain in the blue sky posts, the light from the sky comes from the sun and has violet, blue and some green light in it, leaving mostly red, orange and yellow left coming straight from the sun. This is why the sun looks yellow-red during sunset.\n\nThe final physical step is that clouds are white. This is from a slightly different type of scattering called [Mie scattering](_URL_0_). When the particles (in this case water drops in the coulds) are much larger than the wavelength of light, they scatter it pretty much the same, no matter the wavelength, this gives clouds, paper and milk their white colour.\nSo we have a redish-orange sun and bluish sky reflected from white clouds, because of the way our eyes work we don't see the clouds as both red and blue, the colours are mixed. If you recall art class, red and blue make purple, and depending on how much of the light is reflected from each source the colour of the clouds vary from pink to purple to orange.",

The 3 most common are:\n\n*electrical signals between neurons\n*chemical signals (neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, etc)\n*hormonal changes\n\nIt's extremely unlikely that you could \"feel\" any of these, because your brain does not have the necessary sensors.  This is why brain surgery is typically conducted on a patient who is awake. If he cannot feel the surgery as it happens it is best to keep him awake so he can provide feedback to surgeons.\n\nThe most likely explanation for what you're experiencing is that it is somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy. That is, you're working hard mentally, this makes you believe your brain might be changing, so you perceive that change whether or not it actually happened.

        "answer": "**Edit preface:** I started writing this post thinking I was on /r/science, and didn't realize this was /r/ELI5. I'm gonna finish the post the way I started it, but I'll write a TL;DR when I'm done.\n\nHi there, exercise physiologist here. It's a Sunday, meaning no OP testing, meaning I'm bored as hell and have access to the hospital library. I'll take a stab at it.\n\nLet me set something straight about performance supplementation: for most of the substances below, there is little evidence suggesting that exogenous performance aids impart any chronic increase in exercise performance. That is, the positive effects of supplementation generally last only as long as the substances are being metabolized [1]. The only exceptions in the list below are the hormonal agents hGH and testosterone.\n\nThe two major supplements you're mentioned, exogenous [creatine](_URL_1_) and [erythropoietin](_URL_10_), are used to increase performance through different mechanisms.\n\nCreatine monohydrate significantly improves the anaerobic (non-oxygen-utilizing) metabolic pathways, which leads to greater power output. However, excessive, long-term supplementation has been linked to renal problems and other associated toxicity [2][3].\n\nExogenous erythropoietin (AKA epoetin), on the other hand, increases the percent of red blood cells in a given volume of blood (called the [hematocrit](_URL_7_)) by stimulating RBC production in bone marrow. A higher hematocrit means more oxygen per unit of blood, meaning higher possible oxygen utilization (increased VO2max) [4][7]. This improves all aspects of performance, but cardiovascular endurance exercise benefit the most. Note that an excessively high hematocrit can cause a condition called [polycythemia](_URL_5_), in which the viscosity of blood is too high, and the blood can't flow smoothly through the vessels in the body. This can cause thrombosis, distal appendage hypoxia, and excessive strain on the heart [4][5].\n\nIn a similar practice called [blood doping](_URL_15_) (AKA autologous blood transfusion), an athlete banks their own blood, then receives that as a transfusion to increase blood volume (increasing VO2max etc. etc.). This carries the same risks as epoetin, plus increased BP due to hypervolemia [6].\n\nVery common pharmacological agents, [sympathomimetic amines](_URL_6_) (better known as amphetamines), are often used as stimulants to improve performance. The risks associated with these drugs are very high, however, as they can induce certain kinds of cardiac arrhythmias and delay the sensation of fatigue, which causes athletes to push themselves too far and injure or even kill themselves [1].\n\n\u03b2-receptor antagonists, or [\u03b2-blockers](_URL_12_), are primarily used in the medical field to manage tachycardia (high heart rate) and hypertension (high blood pressure). [4] They can also be used athletically to reduce anxiety, slow the heart rate, and reduce the small movements associated with breathing and the heartbeat. In athletes with existing (perhaps undiagnosed) cardiopulmonary conditions, \u03b2-blockers can exacerbate those conditions. A few side effects include bronchospasm in asthmatics, heart block in bradycardics, and hypoglycemia in diabetics [1].\n\nCaffeine, often found in the form of pre-workout supplements, is a stimulant so common I won't even bother linking Wikipedia for it. It reduces fatigue and improves free fatty acid mobilization, as well as improving concentration, mood, and reaction time. Bear in mind that chronic caffeine intake is known to cause hypertension due to its vasoconstrictive mechanism [8].\n\nTwo hormonal agents, [human growth hormone](_URL_8_) (hGH) and [testosterone](_URL_0_) (anabolic steroids), are used to augment the natural muscle building capabilities during exercise. The benefits of both are fairly clear, so I'll skip right to the bad side. Both steroids and hGH are linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the #1 cause of sudden death in athletes [7]. Steroids can also cause infertility [9], markedly depressed HDL (good cholesterol) levels [1], and prostate enlargement, which increases the risk of prostate cancer [1][10]. These two agents are the only ones in this list shown to have long-lasting effects beyond their metabolic life [1].\n\n**TL;DR:** Drugs are bad mmkay. But seriously, if you actually want to improve your long-term performance, supplementation isn't the way. Most supplements only improve performance for a short time, and the ones that last longer are irresponsibly dangerous. A proper workout routine that follows the FITT-VP model (frequency, [intensity](_URL_2_), time, type, volume, progression) [as described by the ACSM](_URL_13_) has significantly longer-lasting positive effects and zero negative effects compared to ergogenic aids.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

        "answer": "It means pretty much the same thing, for different kinds of apps.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption refers to when two clients (or more) communicate with each other through a shared server (such as e-mail and Whatsapp). \"End-to-end\" means that the server isn't involved in the encryption - one client encrypts the data and only the other client can decrypt it, meaning that no one in the middle, not even the server, can see the data.\n\nClient-side encryption is similar, but refers to when there's only one client which sends data to a server (such as cloud storage services). The client encrypts the data, and only the client can decrypt it - at no point can the server see the decrypted data.\n\nClient-side encryption is somewhat stronger, because the encryption key doesn't need to be shared between different clients - it's only kept on one computer. (Of course we have key exchange algorithms which solve this problem, but not sharing the key at all is still more secure)",

What do you ACTUALLY get with 4G and LTE, especially compared to 3G, etc.?  Thanks so much to the experts.",
        "answer": "The first thing you need to understand is that G stands for Generation.  4G isn't the same from country to country because it's just the generation of system they're on.  That's why South Korea has faster data transfer and still calls it the same thing we do in the US.\n\nAs far as the difference between 3G and 4G, 4G is newer, and thus better.  It's like comparing a computer from 2012 to a computer from 1997.  Faster, works better, etc, just because technology has evolved.  Phones that are 4G capable can pick up 3G signal, because they're backwards compatible, like how you can play GameCube games on the Wii even though the Wii is newer.  3G phones can't pick up 4G because it wasn't around when they were programmed, like how you can't play Wii games on a GameCube.\n\nLTE stands for Long Term Evolution.  It's basically trying to make it so as technology evolves and improves your phone can still pick up the faster signal because it won't change much other than by speeding up.  So, it's like if Nintendo came out with another game system, using the LTE system, you'd be able to play those type of games on your Wii and on the new system, but you wouldn't have to buy the new system just to be able to play the games.\n\nEdit: spelling",

In America, every sport has one major league, with a regular season and a playoff to crown a champion each year. \n\nI'm trying to follow European soccer, and while I understand each country has their own league, apparently there are multiple instances where teams from different leagues play each other? \n\nThe tournaments (playoffs) have varying degrees of prestige and importance among them, and teams can be kicked out of leagues for being bad? \n\nPlease explain these dynamics, as I'm having a hard time understanding them. \n\nThanks so much. ",
        "answer": "Ok, I'll tell you about English football, but by extension this is roughly how most European football countries have their system as well.\n\nIn football there are various leagues, considered the most prestigious league in the world the [Barclays Premier League](_URL_5_) was created in 1992. It is considered the greatest football league in the world because of its ability to attract world class football players and managers. The teams in the premier league all play against each other over the course of a season, and try to accumulate as many points as possible.\n\n**A win = 3 points for the winning team, the losing team will get no points**\n\n**A draw = 1 point for both teams**\n\nNow once each team has played each other at both their home and away ground the team with the most points become the champions of that league for a year. They get a nice trophy, some cash to buy new players and bragging rights over the rest of the league. At the other end of the table, the three teams with the lowest amount of points (the teams who lost the most games) get relegated to the next league down called the [Championship](\n_URL_0_)\n\nThe Championship is different in many ways, the championship is slightly bigger (it has 24 teams playing in it whereas the premier league has 20) it is not broadcast on satellite TV as much so there is a lot less money in it and the teams who play in the league are for the most part not good enough to play in the premier league. However, they again play a season of football and the three teams who perform best, take the place of the three teams who performed worst in the premier league.\n\nThis set up of leagues promotions and relegations goes on right down to local league level. So this means (in theory) that given enough time and money even the lowliest team started in a small town can get promoted enough times to play in the Premier League.  This brings us on to the [FA](_URL_3_). The FA or Football Association are the governing body of English football (each country has their own FA all goverened by [FIFA](_URL_7_.)) they oversee all complaints had by any clubs, sort out match fixtures, look at the transfers clus are making, they're essentially the headteacher of that countries football. The FA have something called the [FA Cup](_URL_6_) this is a cup in which every single team in England who are signed by the FA can enter. It is a huge and very prestigious tournament and a one of the greatest spectacles of sport. Simply because you can have one of the greatest teams in the world, beaten by a team punching well above their station *cough* City and Wigan *cough cough* \n\nThe FA cup is the only time that teams from other leagues play each other. Otherwise they all stick to their own leagues. \n\nEuropean football is governed by [UEFA](_URL_4_), each continent has a UEFA style of body. This body is responsible for overseeing all European football, they schedule matches for the [UEFA Champions League](_URL_2_) and the [UEFA Europa League](_URL_1_). Teams from the top tier (top league) of all European Leagues are eligible. The teams who finish in the top four of the respective countries top tier of football are automatically eligible and qualify for the Champions League. They play each other in groups of four, with the four teams within that group playing each other. The top two teams in each group then go to the knockout stages where a winner is eventually announced. The Europa League qualification is a little more complicated and something that I don't have much experience in, but you can read up about it on their wiki.\n\nAnd I think that's it, apologies if I got anything wrong or missed anything out. I know I talked a lot about English football but, at least for Europe, I think that they're all pretty much the same so you can just switch between Nations and still have the same basic set up.

        "question": "What affects how rare  &  aggressive cancer is?",
        "question_ctx": "I understand that a tumor is essentially unchecked multiplication of a group of cells but how does this affect how aggressive and how rare cancer can be in an organ. And how can it ultimately be lethal\nI'm sorry that that's a lot of questions.\n",
        "answer": "One of the biggest factors is where in your body the cancer starts.  Every time a healthy cell reproduces, there's a chance it will not copy the DNA correctly and become cancerous.  Some tissues in your body almost never replicate once they're established as you become an adult.  For instance, you almost never see cancer in heart muscle tissue, because those cells almost never reproduce.  The neurons in your brain *never* reproduce, although the glial cells in your brain do.  So you're not going to see brain cancer start with a neuron.\n\nThe cells lining your stomach, on the other hand, reproduce *constantly*, since they get exposed to the harsh, acidic contents of your stomach.  Intestinal cells also reproduce fairly quickly, as do skin cells.  Since they reproduce so often, there are far more chances for those cells to become cancerous, so you're more likely to see cancer start there.\n\nExactly how the cancer progresses depends on so many factors that scientists struggle to predict how the cancer will behave.  There are many built-in safeguards against cancer in your DNA: your cells try to fix damaged DNA, they will terminate themselves if they can't fix it, other cells will kill them if they sense the potential to become cancerous...  And there are multiple locations in your DNA for each of those.  A lot of things have to go wrong for your cell to mutate into cancer, and how that cancer behaves is largely controlled by exactly which things go wrong, *and* what kind of tissue it started as.  Cells that naturally multiply slowly, like glial cells, will most likely be a slower cancer than, say, stomach cancer.\n\nSome tumors grow until some internal signal is switched and it stops.  Some tumors grow rapidly and, worst case scenario, shed more bits of cancer that get into your blood stream and end up all over your body.  But it all depends on which parts of the DNA were damaged and which parts of your DNA were already active in that tissue.\n\nCancer is lethal in a few ways.  Cancer steals resources from your body, so nearby tissues don't get what they need to function and survive.  Cancer cells need energy and oxygen like any other part of your body, but they need *more* since they're trying to multiple faster than they should.  So cancer can hijack your blood vessels and slowly starve other parts of your body.  Say the nearby organ is your liver...well, now your liver doesn't have enough oxygen to function so it isn't filtering your blood, which poisons you.\n\nCancer can replace healthy tissues in your organs so those organs can't function.  Think about a tumor growing in your lung: that tumor might have started as lung cells, but as a tumor they aren't doing the job that lung tissue is supposed to do.  So that lung can't pull oxygen like it should, suffocating you.\n\nCancer can also physically interfere with organs by taking up space in your body and squeezing them.  Think about a tumor in your brain: there's nowhere for your brain to go if the tumor starts expanding inside your skull.  It puts pressure on your brain, shoving neurons out the way and preventing them from forming and holding the connections required to function.  Or a tumor could squeeze your kidney so blood can't flow through it.\n\nIf a tumor that metastasizes (splits cells off to grow in other parts your body) can end up creating tiny tumors growing inside your blood stream, which can clog your arteries and cause a heart attack or stroke.",

        "answer": "Nature tends to want things to be at equilibrium - as related to temperature, heat will transfer from hot things (like you) into cold things (like the air or water) until both are the same temperature.\n\nNow, this happens at different rates depending on how well a conductor of heat the surrounding materials are.  Air conducts heat very poorly, so it takes longer for heat to move from your body to the surrounding air.  Water conducts heat very well, so heat from your body quickly moves into the surrounding water.  As a result, the water feels cold because it is sucking the heat out of your skin very quickly, while air feels fine because it is doing that much more slowly (slow enough for your body to compensate for the heat loss)",

In order to recoup those COSTS and make some money for my time and effort, I PRICE the milk at $2.00 a gallon. (I net .50 but that's a story for another day) your mother buys the milk from me and brings it home to you. Later on the neighbor comes over and asks if they can buy a gallon of milk, and you ask him for $100 because that is the VALUE it has to you. He may offer you $5.00 which is more than double the acquisition price at my store because your neighbor feels that not having to drive to the store in the middle of cooking adds VALUE. However since, you don't agree as to the VALUE he sets for the milk, you say no, and he leaves cursing about how crazy you are, and you continue you life with a very strange outlook on milk purchased by your mother.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

The US is a young country and was in it's \"golden age\" during the 20th century.  It was inventing itself, all the while being a major player on the world stage.  With 300+ military bases worldwide, its presence is felt in every corner of the globe. \n\nTwo major new art forms- Jazz and then Rock  &  Roll- were invented in America and teenagers all over the planet ate it up whenever they could.\nHollywood is nothing like the world had ever seen and was/is a a major export.  Television is privately run, unlike many other countries that have state run television stations like the BBC or dozens of others. This allowed the power of capitalism to press any angle it could.  The press is free allowing magazine images to litter the world.\n\nJapan did a hard reset after WW2 and even though it is an ancient country, it put everything it had into re-inventing itself.  Industry thrived. If you had an electronic device in the 1970's-1990's, chances are it was made in Japan.  People everywhere were and still are  driving Japanese cars.  The video game revolution would not have happened when it did if not for Japanese companies.

        "question_ctx": "For example,i intentionally or not break a car's window,or hit its door,and the alarm goes off.\nWhat makes it to go off? ",
        "answer": "It's pretty simple, really. A lot more simple than people think. When a window get smashed, you abruptly change the air pressure inside the car. There is a sensor somewhere inside the car that detects the pressure change.\n\nThe same sensor reacts when you have a large dog barking inside the car too, so most car alarms have a setting where you can turn off that sensor either temporarily or permanently.\n\nAdded to that, some cars have vibration sensors. They detect when the car is lifted, so that you can't steal the rims without the alarm going off.\n\nIncidentally, those sensors also react to things that are unrelated, like earth quakes or when a train passes by a poorly built parking lot.\n\nThen, to make it harder to bypass the alarm, it reacts when the car battery gets disconnected.\n\nSome alarms also react when you try to remove a light bulb (because, you know, if it ain't blinking people won't react quickly enough) and most of them protect themselves from short circuited lamps because that is one of the oldest tricks in the book to cull an old aftermarket alarm system.\n\nTo top it off, the alarm often has its own battery so that it can run the siren independently from the cars electrical system for half an hour or so.\n\nThe rest is about entry control. There is a switch in each door. Including the tank cap and the engine compartment.\n\nSometimes you also replace the central locking motors with motors that are able to lock themselves, because that is also an old trick; if you can physically move the motor in the drivers door, it will typically order all the other motors to open. So if you manage to get access to the motor, the alarm will actually make it EASIER to get into the car. Unless it can lock itself, that is.",

In some cases, this is a bad thing (you need to know how it works so you can debug your own code) and sometimes it is a good thing (you don't want to get distracted by this thing you think should work) and sometimes it is necessary (Google doesn't want people to know how their search algorithm works, because then people could steal it).\n\nAn interface is an object that doesn't actually do anything. It relies on it's implementation to actually do the work. A delegate is a group of methods or tasks that can be completed.\n\nThink of a program which buys TVs on a website. You would code the logic to determine if the TV is in stock and check how expensive it is and shipping logic and etcetera. However, the only way to buy these TVs is with a credit card. You do not write the logic to clear the credit card. \n\nYou would populate an Interface with the data you know (Name, Billing Address, Card Number, Expiration Date, Security Number). In the case of credit card numbers, you can actually tell what kind of card they have (visa, mastercard, etc) from the number. The implementation of the interface would examine the card number and determine the card type.\n\nYou would then call a Delegate class. First, let's call the \"validate\" method. You pass in the Interface object, and the method returns true or false. If it returns true, then you call the \"charge\" method, passing in the Interface object, with some other parameters (Amount, Who is charging, etc.)\n\nThe delegate method will then call some other code to actually validate the card and charge it, but you don't care how that works. You assume that the delegate works and that if the card is valid, the \"validate\" method returns true and if it's invalid, it returns false. You don't know how and you don't care how.",

Perhaps, a better way to do it is to \n\n* go to school\n\n* go to Target on your way home from school\n\n* stop by the grocery store \n\n* arrive back home.\n\n\nThat's an optimized sequence. Basically, the end result is the same as in the unoptimized case, but you've spent less time doing things.

Perhaps, in San Francisco, it is better to take the home-school-Target-grocery store-home route, while in New York it is better to do home-school-grocery store-Target-home. When you're optimizing your route for a particular city, it may not be the ideal route for some other city.

        "answer": "An article from Scientific American from 2009:  \n\n\n\nCompared with other animals, human babies take much longer to learn to walk. Does this have something to do with our big brains?\n\u2014Mahmoud Dhaouadi, via e-mail\n\nJohn Bock, an anthropologist at California State University, Fullerton, provides a reply:\n\nA HORSE can walk within an hour after birth. A newborn baboon baby can cling to its mother\u2019s hair while she jumps through the trees. Even among  our closest evolutionary relatives\u2014chimpanzees and bonobos\u2014babies are far more agile than their human counterparts. That\u2019s because humans are born with brains that are largely immature, leaving babies with little control over their movements. This uniquely human attribute is the result of a lengthy evolutionary battle between big brains and narrow pelvises.\n\nOne of the first traits that differentiated humans from our ancestors was upright gait. There are several hypotheses about the emergence of this trait, but it seems to have offered a way to move more efficiently in open environments such as the savanna. Although our earliest human ancestors were very apelike in terms of their brains, their upright gait had changed their pelvis to look much like our modern one. This reshaped pelvis came with a narrower birth canal, making childbirth more difficult.\n\nMeanwhile the new roaming grounds afforded advantages in acquiring resources and negotiating social relationships to those with flexible, problem-solving behavior. Over time, natural selection increased brain size in these early humans. But at some point, the selection for bigger and bigger brains collided head-on, so to speak, with the narrow pelvis. If babies\u2019 heads got any bigger, they would get stuck in the birth canal and kill both mother and child. Although natural selection worked to maximize what could be done\u2014for instance, babies\u2019 heads compress as they twist their way around the bones in the pelvis\u2014there simply is not enough room for a big, mature brain to pass through.\n\nAs it turned out, the evolutionary answer was to let the brain keep growing outside the womb before it matures. So in contrast to other mammals, humans have a good bit of development to do after birth. The result is a relatively undeveloped infant who needs lots of care and can do much less for itself than other newborn primates.\n\nPhysiologically, why is the sound of fingernails on a blackboard so unnerving? Is this effect particular to human beings, or are other creatures similarly affected?\n\u2014Rowan Snyder, via e-mail\n\nNeuroscientist Josh McDermott of New York University explains:\n\nPROBABLY A COUPLE of factors combine to make such sounds unpleasant. The first, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the presence of high frequencies. The range between two\nand four kilohertz\u2014approximately that covered by the highest octave of a standard\npiano\u2014seems to contribute the most to the nastiness of the sound. It is unclear why people tend to fi nd these frequencies unpleasant, but we know that noise-induced hearing loss most commonly occurs in roughly this region, so it is conceivable that the aversive reaction partly reflects the ear\u2019s vulnerability.\n\nThe spectrum of screeching sounds is also much noisier than that of an instrument; that is, there is a strong random component to the sound. The noisiness probably results from the fingernails repeatedly catching on part of the chalkboard surface before sliding forward.\n\nThis catching and sliding also causes rapid fluctuations in intensity, giving the sound a \u201crough\u201d character.\n\nRoughness is known to be unpleasant\u2014car manufacturers, who aim to produce minimally unpleasant engine noise, for instance, find that smooth sounds with minimal variation in intensity are preferred by listeners over those that are rough. It\u2019s a bit harder to say why sound roughness is considered unpleasant\u2014as far as we know it is not harmful to the ears.\n\nSome scientists have proposed that screeching sounds are acoustically similar to screams, a sound to which we might plausibly have evolved an aversion. If this hypothesis were true, one might expect to find similar reactions in nonhuman primates, which also produce screams. Thus far only one species of monkey has been tested, and it did not\ndisplay the same aversive response to screeches that humans have. It may therefore be more appropriate to simply regard screeching sounds as a \u201cperfect storm\u201d\u2014combining two properties that we know to be unpleasant, resulting in a single sound that is awful to listen to.\n\nNote: This article was originally printed with the title, \"Ask The Brains.\"",

        "answer": "I think most people here are forgetting that lotteries are not pure mathematical constructs.  It is a game built by, and manipulated by people.  Yes, the Gambler's Fallacy suggests that all thing are equal in an equal game, but the game is rarely equal.\n\nFirstly, saying that the odds are the same assumes that each lottery ball is built evenly.  It is very possible some balls weigh more than others, changing how likely they are of being picked.  In this example, it is possible that the No.3 ball is the lightest ball, and more likely to fly to top and be picked.  Also, it's possible that when they put the balls in the machine, they do so numerical order.  This might make lower numbers more likely to surface than the higher numbers.\n\nSecondly, some lotteries are fixed.  Intentionally using balls of different weights and sizes make more numbers more likely to appear.  In some draws, people heat the key balls up so that someone picked them by hand could identify them.  For whatever reason, No. 3 could intentionally chosen more often, maybe because the mob boss' son was born in March.\n\nThe classic example of the Gambler's fallacy took place in Monte Carlo when the ball landed on black 26 times in a row.  A lot people lost money because they kept betting on red, think falsely that there is no way that a ball would land on the same spot for as long as it did.  Myself, I would have bet on black, because at that point, I would suspect that the mechanism helping the ball land on black was jammed or something, causing the ball the land on black over and over again.\n\nFor those that doubt me, [something like this happened in a casino in Montreal](_URL_0_).

If Bernie were to win every single one of those districts by a margin of 52-48 each district would have to set their delegate allotment at 5.2 delegates for Bernie, and 4.8 for Hillary. You can't award a fraction of a delegate, so what happens is that they would round, and both candidates would earn 5 delegates.

There used to be one called the \"Neverlate Executive\", but the company that made it manufactured it terribly and you literally cannot purchase it anymore, and I have not been able to find another one, no matter how hard I search.\n\nI can see why a 9-to-5er with the same schedule their entire life wouldn't need this, but for students this kind of thing would be invaluable.

Most would do very badly at memorising thousands of arbitrary strings of letters - and most of those that managed would be completely stumped by new words, regional dialects, phonetic spellings or the very concept of etymology. \n\nThis is one of the big things that the common-core maths curriculum seeks to correct.\n\nIn common-core, less emphasis is put on formal pen-and-paper methods, and more on mental maths strategies, alternate approaches, visualisations, and giving kids a lot more insight into what's going on, how to tackle the problem and *why* it works, rather than just drilling them on what to do. \n\nFrom what I've seen, it could be a real game-changer.",

The G7 is Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., a group of industrial nations that are all economic powers. They have been meeting since 1973 and are all close U.S. allies. In 1998 Russia joined. Their recent statement also implies they might remove Russia from the group.\n\nThat, along with possible economic sanctions, and asset freezes ('locking' the accounts that rich Russians have in non-Russian banks), have caused investors to fear that Russia will be severely affected economically, and as a result Russian based businesses will suffer. As a result investors have been withdrawing their Russian investments. \n\nThis has also had the effect of severely weakening the Russian Ruble (their currency) as everybody trades it for a safer currency. This is because if Russia is hurt economically then they will print off more Rubles to make payments, causing inflation (and making each Ruble worth less).\n\nI'm not certain, but I doubt there was much of an effect on the U.S. stock market. If there was it wasn't anywhere near as bad. This is because nobody threatened sanctions against us, the world standard currency is the USD, large U.S. based companies have a decent part of their trade outside of the U.S., and our economy is far stronger overall.",

        "answer": ">  did they take measures to purify water?\n\nWell they did convert it into alcohol and tea *en masse* so to speak...two pretty good methods of purifying water. Its actually one of the reasons cholera was discovered and the study of [Epidemiology](_URL_1_) was born. \n\n*\"In the mid-1800s, an anesthesiologist named John Snow was conducting a series of investigations in London that warrant his being considered the \u201cfather of field epidemiology.\u201d Snow conducted one of his now famous studies in 1854 when an epidemic of cholera erupted in the Golden Square of London. He began his investigation by determining where in this area persons with cholera lived and worked. He marked each residence on a map of the area. Because Snow believed that water was a source of infection for cholera, he marked the location of water pumps on his spot map, then looked for a relationship between the distribution of households with cases of cholera and the location of pumps. He noticed that more case households clustered around Pump A, the Broad Street pump, than around Pump B or C. When he questioned residents who lived in the Golden Square area, he was told that they avoided Pump B because it was grossly contaminated, and that Pump C was located too inconveniently for most of them. From this information, Snow concluded that the Broad Street pump (Pump A) was the primary source of water and the most likely source of infection for most persons with cholera in the Golden Square area.* **He noted with curiosity, however, that no cases of cholera had occurred in a two-block area just to the east of the Broad Street pump. Upon investigating, Snow found a brewery located there with a deep well on the premises. Brewery workers got their water from this well, and also received a daily portion of malt liquor. Access to these uncontaminated rations could explain why none of the brewery's employees contracted cholera.** *To confirm that the Broad Street pump was the source of the epidemic, Snow gathered information on where persons with cholera had obtained their water. Consumption of water from the Broad Street pump was the one common factor among the cholera patients. After Snow presented his findings to municipal officials, the handle of the pump was removed and the outbreak ended. The site of the pump is now marked by a plaque mounted on the wall outside of the appropriately named John Snow Pub.\"* [CDC Source](_URL_0_)\n\nEdit: to clarify, people back then didn't know that distilling or boiling water *purified* it. On the other hand people who consumed alcohol or tea were less likely to get sick. The correlation between the two wouldn't be fully understood until scientists like John Snow examined the relationship between disease, microbes, and water.",

After getting to a medical facility and having it under control, I went to see my doctor to find out what happened. Blood work was done and it came up that I'm suddenly allergic to peanuts. I am still getting more blood work done because my wheat allergy was slightly high, so my doctor wants to see what my sensitivity to celiac is (not sure if this could be related or help explain things). I've been left completely in the dark by my doctor about this sudden allergy.\n\nI grew up eating peanut related foods on a regular basis. I would snack on a spoonful of peanut butter frequently. If I someone who didn't eat it often I wouldn't be so at a loss. How can this come on so suddenly?",
        "answer": "An allergy is an accidental immune reaction. One of the major features of your immune system is your antibodies. Antibodies are like keys that float around looking for their locks, which are biotic features called antigens. An antigen is a unique tag that living cells produce.\n\nThese antibodies are randomly generated in your lymph nodes. There are upwards of a billion possible antibodies in most people and before they are released into your body they are tested for self-similarity, meaning that if your own cells trigger the antibody it is disassembled so that your immune system doesn't attack your own cells. (In some people this doesn't work, and that's how you get an autoimmune disease.) In most cases, your body will also screen out foreign antigens that are known to be harmless (like peanut antigens).\n\nSo, why do you have a peanut allergy all of a sudden? In your first 30 years, your body never happened upon an antibody that is triggered by a peanut antigen (remember antibodies are randomly assembled). Now, your body has made that antibody and apparently that antibody made it through the screening process. So, the antibody attaches to the antigen and basically posts a sign, saying 'immune system come find me and destroy me.' Meanwhile, it also sends a copy of itself back to your central immune system with a message that says 'I am a useful antibody. Keep making copies of me.'\n\nSo now, unless you happen upon an immune disorder that interrupts the peanut-antigen-antibody making process, your body now things that peanuts are something it's supposed to attack. And voila! Allergies.",

But YouTube is free, so Google isn't going to turn the world upside down to make sure you get a great feed 100% of the time. \n\nIndeed, you'll often find that when YouTube feeds you an ad before the video, it comes through just fine, then the video itself will look like shit, or sometimes end up not even loading at all. That's because someone's paying for those ads, so they're sent from a completely different set of servers, and funny enough, they NEVER seem to have any problems with those.",

        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "Running the DirectX installer is not a matter of making sure your overall DirectX install being up-to-date. Microsoft has a helper library with D3D called D3DX. You'll find binaries for this like d3dx9_43.dll in your Windows\\system32 folder. There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version. As such the game must run the correct D3D installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist.\n\nEven if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly, the only way to distribute them is to run the installer, that's also the only supported method from Microsoft to check that the correct version installed. Trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation. In addition, the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the D3DX runtime. The code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past.\n\nSource: [Steam support knowledgebase](_URL_0_)",

In a foreclosure, the debtor had originally offered the property to the creditor as \"collateral,\" so the money was only given because the creditor knew that, if the debtor didn't pay, they'd have the right to foreclose on the property. \n\nUsually, the term is applied to the sale of real estate, like land or homes. \n\nThe process varies by area and by loan, but the general outline is that someone takes out a loan and then offers some collateral.  At some point they fall behind on the loan or refuse to pay, and the creditor decides to foreclose.  When the creditor is ready, and auction is held, and the property is sold to the highest bidder. \n\nIf there's not enough money to cover the debt after the auction, in some places the creditor can sue the debtor for the difference. In other places that's not allowed.  If there's more than enough money, any extra money goes to the debtor. \n\nAt some point---either before or after the auction---the original debtors who owned the property will have to leave, since the property belongs to the bank.",

        "answer": "Three operations tend to show up in hash functions: modular addition, bitwise logic, and multiplication by primes.\n\n[Modulo operations](_URL_0_) takes the remainder from division -- for example, 2 goes into 7 three times with a remainder of 1, so `2 mod 7` is 1.\n\nModular addition takes modulo and uses it in addition. Instead of simply adding `A` and `B`, you add `A mod X` and `B mod X`. The result is equivalent to `(A + B) mod X`. This is handy because it creates a sort of \"wrapped\" addition, where the output value will never exceed `X`.\n\nBitwise logic allows you to use 2 or more bits of input to generate 1 bit of output. This is handy if you need to combine chunks of data in a hash. Some example operators include:\n\n* `AND` will output a 1 if all of its inputs are 1, or 0 otherwise\n* `OR` will output a 1 if one or more of its inputs are 1, or 0 otherwise\n* `XOR` will output a 1 if *exactly* one of its inputs is 1, or 0 otherwise\n\nPrime multiplication tends to show up a lot in cryptography, because factoring primes is computationally expensive, which means the operation is theoretically difficult to reverse.\n\nSo... let's say that one round of a hashing algorithm might take the hash output so far, `XOR` two chunks of data together to generate some value `H`, multiply `H` by a big prime number, then use modular addition to add that into its running total. After you do this enough times, you've consumed all of the chunks and generated a hash.\n\nThe precise algorithm is beyond ELI5 level, but you can read about it on Wikipedia, including a [pseudocode example](_URL_1_), if you're really curious.",

        "answer": "In modern landfills, the trash doesn't just get thrown into an ever increasing mountain of garbage. Generally a large area is isolated from the surrounding ground, by some combination of non-permeable clay and artificial liners. This is to protect the surrounding environment(especially ground water) from runoff. There's usually some sort of drainage system installed as well, to remove rain water and other liquids that will collect in the landfill over time. \n\nThen it starts getting filled up with trash. Each day the trash is dumped in a specific area, and big machines drive over it to compact it as much as possible. Eventually you start piling trash over previously dumped trash and the landfill starts building up instead of outwards. \n\nWhen it's completely full, they'll usually cover the whole thing with a nice thick layer of dirt, and eventually vegetation will cover it. \n\nThere are also other layers of complexity that can sometimes be implemented. Trash tends to have a lot of biological material in it (old food and such) that can be broken down by microbes over time, and that process can release gasses like methane.

The force when an electron is near an atom is incredibly strong, but the force even a few more nano-meters away almost fully disappears, so an electron that is ejected with JUST the right amount of energy will have practically no (but still nonzero) kinetic energy as it moves away from the material it was ejected from.",

So if you're a poor farmer in India and Monsanto's people convince you their seed is amazing and will give you a great crop yield, and you fork over all your money to buy their seed but that year your crop fails...now you're broke and you have no useful seed because if you just replant your crops you'll get sued.  And that's the best case, if you went into debt for those seeds now you're in the hole money you can't recoup without a harvest, but you can't harvest anything without licensing more plants...or totally reinvesting in seed from somewhere else...that you can't afford because you're in debt.  This actually cause a rash of farmer suicides.\n\nAlso since plants are living things they tend to attempt to reproduce, so if GMO wheat from Monsanto's research farm in Oregon spreads itself and ends up in your organic farm, your certifications are all in trouble.  If you're big enough to sell to other states or countries if they don't allow GMO wheat you can't sell to them anymore, your whole business is fucked.  This also happened.\n\nFinally, if you're a farmer, and your neighbor's a farmer, and he buys Monsanto's seeds but you don't.  Some seasons later Monsanto comes over and realizes his crops fertilized your crops and now you're growing hybrid plants through no intent of your own.  Technically that's patent infringement and now Monsanto is suing you because the guy next door to you bought their product and then plants did their thing and tried to make more plants.",

Instead what you get is a really really really good near-real-time updated 3d simulation of a convenient-to-navigate model of the universe.\n\nThink of it this way. Most of the matter around you is made up of completely empty space. A rock you press against isn't actually solid, but your brain represents it as such to you, because at the scale which you exist, that representation is a lot more useful than what's actually there.\n\nWhich, for reference, is basically little bits of nothing deflecting other little bits of nothing with big powerful fields that extend far beyond the meager size of the actual atomic components.\n\nMore so, time itself doesn't actually \"flow\" so much as it exists as a convenient metric by which we can measure change in our own existence. In reality, time is inherently locked together with space into what is called (and you've likely heard of) spacetime. One of the consequences of this is that you shouldn't think of time as some kind of a line that a 3d cube (representing the universe) is moving along. Rather, the reason photons never \"age\" is because they're moving at the speed of light. Anything moving that fast experiences \"0 time\", as it were.\n\nAll this to say: your brain is basically a super-duper powered xbox capable of an incomprehensible number of computations. [1 second of simulated brain activity took almost 85,000 processors](_URL_0_). It takes in a ridiculous number of inputs from the outside world and uses these to create a coherent model of your surroundings, which is really very beneficial to your continued survival.

        "question_ctx": "So I read on wikipedia the example about Disneyland, but I'm wondering what the basis is behind Baudrillard's theory, and why he has the belief that the earth isn't real to begin with. Also, if possible, what the possible benefits or harms come along with the hyperreal.",
        "answer": "He bases his thought not on the perception of earth not being real, but with the impossibility of determining the reality of earth when the human mind is more allured by the purpose, or significance of something within a system, rather than its actual \"realness\" or \"existence\" (as he put, a human emphasis on the **sign** value of an object rather than its **functional** or **exchange** value of an object). It reveals a human's quest for the ideal, that may block true understanding of the world.\n\nDisneyland, for example, emphasizes a more simple, idealistic reality where the nature of things manifest in a manner not tied to realistic restrictions. A shopkeeper in Disneyland, for example, does not make, clean, or organize the merchandise he sells. Factory workers, and people you do not see accomplish that, but when this shopkeeper can devote his entire job to only selling his merchandise and appearing happy, the positive manner in which he portray's his visible **role** in society makes that society seem more appealing, because we are looking at the **sign** value of the shopkeeper, and choose to ignore how he got himself to that position in the shop. He is a simulacrum of a real shopkeeper. (which in reality leads to his fatigue, sadness, or lack of focus, but in Disney is surreptitiously cast aside.)\n\nIn terms of benefits or harms, idealized views of society or people based on their sign value, ie. what they represent, leads to a flawed view of reality. For example, Ronald Reagan represented a suave, calm, and confident American demeanor, one which seemed very optimistic about America's power and future. He is seen as a better leader because people look at that ideal he may have represented, rather than his political views, intelligence, stances, laws, administration, effects on the economy, and foreign policy. Another example is that people look to the past as being ideal, while in reality the flaws and problems with this past overshadows the ideals they represent. Owen Wilson's character in Midnight in Paris eventually overcame this flaw, for he at first dreamed of how much better the past (1920s Paris) was.\n\nIt is a retreating fantasy, within which we can find a certain happiness, for our ideals, the base natures of things which we know to understand, manifest without the endless restriction of reality. Animated films isolate and emphasize features which easily distinguish humans (eyes, characteristics, movements), so that we can connect more easily in this simulated Hyperreality. \n\nThis departure to Hypperreality was Baudrillard's understanding of a human's quest for meaning which often takes a more simple, yet seemingly more encompassing view of reality by seeing an object or idea for what it represents and may imply, rather than its true nature whose manifestation is more complicated, and less fulfilling. \n\n**TL;DR:** Hyperreality is a human's emphasis of focus on what things represent in a system, rather than what they manifest as in reality. This delusion leads to a limited view of the world, which can both harm in its allure, yet provide a respite of comfort and understanding.",

        "question": "Different types of Web Hosting. ",
        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "There are three main kinds of hosting, Shared, VPS and Dedicated. I guess you can add \"Cloud\" to that nowadays, but the definitions aren't presise.\n\n**Shared hosting** is the cheapest, basically there's a single computer which hosts hundreds of websites. They're all running on the same computer and competing for resources. So for instance, if one of the sites uses up all the CPU power, all the other sites slow down as a result of it. \nUsually shared hosting is only really good for small websites that don't do much.\n\nThe next one up is VPS which stands for **Virtual Private Server**. This is similar to shared hosting in that there are several websites running on the same computer, but its different that, each of the websites is running within its own operating system, so it \"thinks\" its on its own private server (thats why its called virtual). They're still sharing the same hardware, but the way they share it is more fair. Usually they will directly split-up the resources of the hardware, so if five VPS are running on one computer, each will get a fraction the resources, for itself.\nVPS are better because other people's sites can't disrupt your site as much, however it's not perfect and things still slow down when everyone is doing alot.\n\n**Dedicated Servers** are the most expensive option. You are basically paying a company to rent a whole computer in their data-centre for yourself. You can often install whatever software you want, configure the operating system however you want, it's your computer. However of course this is more expensive because each computer takes physical space, power, bandwidth, etc.\n\n\n**Cloud** servers are a modern thing that has come about in the past few years.  Amazon EC2 is an example. They're quite similar to VPS, in that you get to run your own \"virtual\" computer but usually the way that virtual computer is linked to and limited by the real hardware is different. Cloud computing networks will have a large network of real computers, which the various \"virtual\"/\"cloud\" instances run ontop of, but unlike VPS where its often a fixed number per computer, cloud computing allows you to dynamically scale, so if you need more processing power, you can turn on more processing power, if you need less, you turn some off. The idea of cloud is that you pay for computing as a service, rather than a product. So it's like how you pay for water to you facet (depending on how much you use) rather than paying for bottles of water at the supermarket (a certain price for a certain pre-determined volume)",

        "question_ctx": "[deleted]",
        "answer": "Mortgages and car loans are different from credit cards (and some other kinds of credit) in exactly this way. The vocabulary is that mortgages and car loans are *secured debt*; the house or the car or the jewelry at the pawn broker is *security* for the debt, and if the debt isn't paid, the creditor can take ownership of whatever was provided as security.\n\nCredit cards belong to the opposite category, *unsecured debt.* There's no asset to be forfeit if the borrower doesn't pay. Instead, the creditor can sue the borrower, and a judge will order him to pay. If the borrower refuses, he can be fined (though why the judge would expect him to pay his fines when he's already refusing to pay his debts is unclear) or jailed for *contempt of court.* In some cases, a judgement may allow the court to seize wages or property to pay your debts.\n\nSecured debt it usually available at a lower interest rate, because, well, foreclosing on a house is a hassle, but at the end of the day, the bank ends up owning a house, which isn't nothing. They don't lose more than a fraction of their loan (unless the value of the house has decreased, because of a fire, or, say, the 2007-8 housing collapse).\n\nSecured and unsecured debts are handled differently if you go bankrupt. In bankruptcy, the court basically creates a corporation to handle your debts, and gives all your money and stuff (with exceptions, which can actually be pretty extensive) to that corporation, which then sells everything and tries to pay off the debts.  The key here is, the corporation gives secured creditors their security assets first, and then splits up whatever's left among the unsecured creditors.",

It's less safe and more likely to cause uneven tire wear. So more dangerous and more expensive.

        "question_ctx": "1. What is praxeology ?\n\n2. How is it different from Chicago School?\n\n3. Why isn't it taken seriously by academia ?\n\n4. How legitimate is it ?",
        "answer": "The Austrian School of economic thought basically says that the decisions of individuals matter more than that of a group of people together. Obviously a group of people has more pull than any one person, but this school more scrutinizes what each individual person in the group does, whereas most other schools of economics don't care about that they only want to know what the end result of the activities of the group in question.\n\nFor example: 5 friends go to a bar, 4 of them buy one drink, and one of them gets bombed and gets 11 drinks. On average they got 3 each, so most economists would care about that, however the austrian school really wants to know why that one guy got bombed and the others didn't. \n\n_URL_0_\n\nThe Chicago School focuses on rejecting keynesianism in favor of neo-classicalism. \n\nWhat are these two theories? Keynesianism is the theory that the government should intervene in the market in order to achieve the best possible result. For example: Keynesians are usually in favor of \"smoothing out the business cycle\". When times are good, they raise taxes and cut government spending, to achieve a government surplus and not allow the economy to get too out of hand. When the economy is bad, they lower taxes and boost spending, running deficits in order to boost economic activity and get things going again. Their main goal is to have a steady amount of small growth, rarely having big booms or recessions/depressions.\n\nNeoclassicalism on the other hand is the opposite. It aims to have as little government intervention in the economy as possible and believes this contributes to the best economic picture. In this type of system the government attempts to keep itself neutral at all times, rarely running surpluses or deficits. It allows bubbles to form and burst as they will, leading to large fluctuations in the state of the economy. Sometimes things are awesome and sometimes they suck. However they believe that over time the awesomeness more than cancels out the suck (to put it basically). \n\n_URL_1_\n\nI can't really explain why academia doesn't accept the austrian school, but at first glance it seems a little suspect. I am no economist however I did take a few economics classes back in the day, and I definitely think the Chicago school makes more sense, or even keynesianism (which I am not a big fan of).",

I had surgery 4 days ago. In the pre-op, I had four separate needles punctured in my skin. Two for an IV on one forearm which was the biggest needle (blood was also drawn from here), another for blood to drawn from on the other forearm which was the smallest needle and an injection on my stomach which was by far the most painful of the four. You can't see the spot on the stomach where the injection was, and you can barely see the mark from the IV, but there's a half-dollar sized bruise from where the blood was drawn. All of these happened probably within 20 minutes of each other, and as far as I know the skin was all in the same healthy condition. I had previously assumed that it was the size of the needle that caused bruising, but clearly that isn't the case, at least for my situation, and curiosity's gotten the better of me. ",
        "answer": "The smaller injections most likely didn\u2019t hit a vein, so you won\u2019t get much bruising from those.

You may have twitched a bit more on one or the nurse had a little harder time sticking you on that one. \n\n3) the nurse didn\u2019t put enough pressure when she backed the needle out to seal the vein long enough for it to close itself off.",

        "question": "Why are countries widely known as names that aren't their actual names? For example; what The West knows as Japan, is actually named Nippon/Nihon within the country itself. And there's others!",
        "question_ctx": "Other examples include;\nSpain; named Espa\u00f1a in the country itself.\nGermany is really Deutschland.\nChina is most commonly know as Zhongguo within the country.\nAnd I'm sure there are plenty others.\n\nIs it just me, or does it seem almost rude that, seemingly, these countries aren't in control of how they're named outside of their home country on a global scale? Like, if the Japanese refer to their home country as Nippon, then why doesn't the rest of the world? Why have these countries seemingly accepted the fact that they don't even control their own name outside of their borders?\n\nMaybe I'm blowing this all out of proportion, maybe I'm just super tired and the explanation is obvious, but please help out a genuinely confused person here!",
        "answer": "There are various reasons for this. I'll try to summarize a few.\n\nSometimes the country name actually means something, and so can actually be translated. For example, \"United States\" means, literally, states which are united, and so is translated into French as \"\u00c9tats-Unis\", into German as \"Vereinigte Staaten\", and Russian as \"Soyedinyonnye Shtaty\".\n\nSometimes the name of a country might change, but some languages keep using the old name. For example, the Korean for South Korea is \"Daehan Minguk\", which North Korea is \"Chos\u014fn Minjuju\u016di Inmin Konghwaguk\": the English \"Korea\" refers to the name \"Koryo\", the name of the peninsula from the 10th to the 14th centuries.\n\nLanguages change and evolve quite naturally, and as words go from one language to another, they may undergo changes. Sometimes these are grammatical, so the \"-ia\" ending in Latin-based languages shows up as \"-ien\" in German and often disappears in German, for example. The Latin name for Spain was \"Hispania\": in the Spanish and French languages the \"H\" got left off, so we have \"Espa\u00f1a\" in Spanish (the \"-\u00f1a\" is pronounced \"-nya\", so that's where the \"-ia\" went) and \"Espagne\" in French (the \"gn\" is pronounced like Spanish \"\u00f1\"); then in German the initial \"E\" went missing, giving us \"Spanien\", and in English the ending went AWOL and the vowel was pronounced differently (part of a process of the evolution of the English language known as the Great Vowel Shift).\n\nSometimes the name given to a country originated in the name of a tribe living there, but when more than one tribe or nation lived in that area, different countries gave different names. The Romans called Germany \"Germania\", apparently the name of a tribe they thought lived there, the Germanii; the French looked over the River Rhine and the people living in that part of Germany were the Alemanni, hence the French word \"Allemagne\". The \"Deutsch\" in \"Deutschland\" apparently comes from a word that ultimately means \"ordinary people\" and was the name of the Teutonic tribe -- the process of language change means that although \"Deutsch\" and \"Teuton\" look very different, they're actually related -- and so we get names for Germany like \"Duitsland\" (Dutch) and \"Tedesco\" (Italian).\n\nSometimes the country's own word for their land means something like \"people\", while their word for one of their neighbours might mean \"stranger\" or something.\n\nFor example, when the Saxons invaded Britain, the Celtic tribes that they drove to the west were, to them, \"wealh\" = \"foreigner\"; hence our words \"Wales\" for the country and \"Welsh\" for the people and language. In Welsh, on the other hand, the word for the Welsh people is \"Cymry\" (pronounced \"come-ree\"), which probably means \"comrades\" or something similar, and the country is called \"Cymru\" (almost the same pronounciation as \"Cymry\"); meanwhile, to them, the English are \"Saeson\" -- \"Saxons\" -- and England is called \"Lloegr\" which probably originally meant \"border\", or \"land beyond the border\".\n\nOccasionally, the name of a country or its people is an insult. Many Slavic languages (Polish, Russian, etc) have words for \"Germany\" or \"German\" that are based around \"nemets\", which described a person unable to speak intelligibly.\n\nIt's difficult to control the name of the country beyond your borders because, well, that would be interfering in other countries' languages. However, the African country formerly known to English speakers as \"Ivory Coast\" has asked that it be known for official and diplomatic purposes by its French name, \"C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\", French being the official language there. They have no authority to actually impose this on other countries except to say they won't officially recognise any other version, but it's generally been accepted.",

        "question_ctx": "[removed]",
        "answer": "Because that's how our eyes work. We have 3 types of colour receptor that respond to different overlapping wavelengths of light. Our brains interpret signals from these as red, green and blue. \n\nEssentially every colour we can see is a combination of red, green and blue. Yellow is what we see when both the red and green receptors are activated. In other words, if our eyes see red and green light at the same time, our brains interpret that as yellow.\n\nThis works different to the \"primary colours\" you might have learnt as a small child. That's because then it was about paints. Paints work the opposite way, they remove colours of light rather than adding them. Yellow paint reflects red and green light, and absorbs blue. So when you mix it with blue, that absorbs red light, leaving just the green reflected. That's why mixing yellow and blue paint makes green.\n\nThe primary colours we teach small children are still not quite right, even when talking about paint. Really the primary colours of paint should be cyan, yellow and magenta. Each of them is a half way point between the primary colours of light, red, green and blue.",

        "answer": "Well, lets start with the food itself. The food components used in a luxury restaurant like a Michelin-starred one are generally of very high quality and fresh. Where \"normal\" restaurants may substitute with e.g. pre-made sauces and pasta, a luxury restaurant of certain reputation will always prepare everything fresh and by themselves. Deep fried products and other convenience foods are (almost) never used. So, besides the high purchasing prices of the components used in \"luxury\" food, you have to add the cost of time needed for its preparation. Producing a stack of self-made ravioli, for example, takes a lot of time.\n\nAnd all this time that is needed forces a luxury restaurant to have enough kitchen staff/cooks to deal with the immense workload they have to deal with if the restaurant is full. Cooks in luxury restaurants are usually very well-educated and have a lot of experience, so they are paid very well. This is especially true for the chef (de cuisine), since he is the one that designs the product and is responsible for its success. A huge amount of creativity, sense of taste and understanding of different kinds of tastes and cuisines is necessary, so you can imagine that they'll earn a lot.\n\nBut it doesn't end at the kitchen staff. If you go to a luxury restaurant, you expect excellent service which is provided by well educated and experienced waiters, lead by an even more experienced Maitre d'. Additional services usually include a Sommelier who counsels you on your choice of wine for your dish. All these people want to get paid, too.\n\nThen you have the equipment. Tables, chairs, chinaware, silverware, tablecloths, napkins... you name it. Where \"normal\" restaurants might not concern themselves too much with the condition of your silverware, a luxury restaurant cannot afford anything less than perfection, so theiy'll replace anything that looks remotely worn out quickly. Costs that have to be covered, too.\n\nAnd on top of that you have an owner, who wants to drive a Porsche, too.

Although the days of slavery or indentured servitude were long past it was still often a pretty shitty life to be black and Jamaican in the 30s. There wasn't a lot of education available, most work was hard and agricultural and prospects for most people were pretty bleak. \n\nWhen a Jamaican politician called Marcus Garvey started talking openly about black nationalism and black pride a lot of people got really excited by it but not always in the way he really intended! His ideas about black nationalism and pride in African heritage became entangled with Jamaica's Christian faith and developed into a movement of it's own. When Haile Sellassie came to the throne in Ethiopia it was seen as a great event of black pride, here was an African country which had never been colonized or conquered by Europeans having an amazing coronation and the Emperor being accepted on equal footing with all the royalty of Europe! Over time people started to take this a bit more seriously and thinking of Marcus Garvey as a John the Baptist like figure and Halle Sellassie as not just an awesome dude, but as a religious figure. \n\nStreet preachers started showing up the streets proclaiming that Haile Sellassie was the second coming of Jesus (Jah) and that he was going to lead the people of Jamaica to Heaven (Zion/Ethiopia) over the next twenty years or so the movement evolved into a religion (albeit one without any central texts or central teachings outside the regular bible) .\n\nThey believe that Jamaicans are God's new chosen people. if not necessarilly literally jewish, they think of themselves as the Hebrew's spiritual successors, with a special relationship with god. This is why there's all sort of references to Zion, the Lion of Judeh and other terms from the old testament.\n\nThey believe that they currently live in a kind of living hell (Babylon) where the black man is oppressed by the white man, and that through hard work and improving the lives of others they can ascend to heaven (Zion) \n\nCannabis (Ganja) is used as a sacrament. A common ritual is called a 'reasoning' where people gather together, some weed and talk to Jah(Jesus)\n\nA lot of Rasta believe in a physical afterlife, involving their current physical bodies lasting forver.\n\nDreadlocks and beards came from a passage in the bible banning blades being used on the skin. The Rastas of the 40s interpreted this to include razors and combs as well so they grey their out which singled them out from other Jamicans at the time. \n\nThey have a very distinctive patois and vocabulary. A lot of this came from the original 1920s black nationalism movement where English was being rejected as a colonial language being imposed.\n\nRastafarianism is very much a faith of it's time and place, from it's peak in the 60s where there were about 2 million rastafarians in jamiaca there are probably only about 400,000 or so worldwide now. A lot of people who identify with rastafarianim now do so on cultural grounds rather than faith. It's associated with super-Jamaicaness and is more of a lifestyle than a religion or political movement. \n\nA lot of the decline comes from growing access to education, travel and media and that Jamaicans were able to see for themselves that Ethiopia was very much NOT a physical heaven and that although a lot of them are certainly jerks, the white man is NOT the devil.",

        "question": "Military officers swear to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, not the President",
        "question_ctx": "Can the military overthrow the President if there is a direct order that may harm civilians?",
        "answer": "There are two areas of thought that apply.  The first is for the enlisted and the second is for officers.\n\nWhile there is a common duty to disobey orders that are \"illegal, immoral, or unethical\", a further duty to steward and lead dissent is implied in the officer's oath versus the enlisted oath.\n\nThe enlisted oath expressly states that the enlisted will \"follow the orders of the President of the United States and the officers appointed over me\".  The officer oath has no such passage.  Instead, officers are charged to \"protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic\".  The latter oath is more akin to that taken by a federal office holder (cabinet member, Congressman, President, etc.).  This is further compounded by the fact that the officer oath contains the phrase, \"of the office about which I am about to enter\".\n\nThat is, officers should hold Constitutional values above all else in their duties.  While enlisted should do the same, the big picture may not always be evident to them.  They are not charged to think second and third order effects of being told to, for example, mow the grass.  If that act itself is legal, moral, and ethical, they must comply.  Officers, by a reasonable measure, may decline to do so and decline for members under their command to do so if it can be reasonably defended that the act or operation as a whole is somehow of detriment to the Constitution.\n\nTl;dr: The President is just another dude who is responsible for defending the Constitution and serving the nation.  An important guy, but just a guy.  He is fallible and susceptible to the flaws of man.  Therefore, everyone swears fealty not to a man, but to the Constitution, the base document of our nation and ideals.  That way you would not break an oath if the President went crazy.  But you better be damn sure he went crazy before you disobeyed.  \n\nSource: was a military officer and studied Constitutional law.\n\nEDIT: It's been a while since I reenlisted a service member but I should have remembered that there is a part about supporting and defending the Constitution in the enlisted oath.  Rather the part about obeying orders is OMITTED from the officer's oath.  Obviously everyone should support and defend the Constitution.  The basic premise above, however, is the same.  The omission defaults an officer's charge to think critically about the larger picture.  Thanks to those in the comments that reminded me.\n\nEDIT the second: In my opinion, no, there is no provision to overthrow the government or President based on an order that may be unlawful, unethical, or immoral.  You would be committing treason at that point.  There is a proper way to dissent -- through inaction if it doesn't pass the legal, ethical, and moral test.\n\nEDIT the third: Thanks for the gold!\n\nEDIT the fourth: KesselZero's comment below is a more succinct answer to the actual question at hand.  Basically, our Constitutional system of government has several redundant mechanisms to prevent a rouge (rogue) President.  \n\nEDIT the fifth: I'm keeping my typo, dammit.",

        "answer": "In the UK ~~school~~ education is compulsory up to age 16, when students take their GCSEs (General Certificate of Education). You get one GCSE per subject. Students have some level of choice over which subjects to take, but things like maths, English and science are compulsory. Student can end up with anything between about 4 and 14 GCSEs, but 10 or 11 is most common. They will be awarded a grade (A*-E, or U for ungraded) for each GCSE they take.\n\nAfter GCSEs a student has the choice to quit ~~school~~ education or go on to get further qualifications. The most common of these qualifications are called A levels. \n\nA levels typically take 2 years to complete and are studied at either a 'sixth form college' which basically means staying in school for years 12 and 13 (GCSEs are taken in year 11), or just a college, which is not the same as the colleges you have in the States. Here, college refers to an institution for post 16 learning, but below degree level. Whichever way you choose, the qualification is worth the same. \n\nStudents have complete choice over which subjects they wish to study, provided they have the necessary GCSEs. Most students start off taking 4 A levels and continue 3 on into the 2nd year. (They still get a qualification for the one they drop, it's called an advanced subsidiary (AS) level and is worth roughly half an A level)\n\nAt the end of the 2nd year they will be graded for each A level they took, again A*-E or a U.\n\nUniversities primarily accept or reject students based on their A level results. Uni applications however typically occur well before the A level results day. Consequently university consider applicants predicted results and then offer them a place *conditional on them getting the required grades*. Results day is therefore a very nerve racking time for students. \n\nHope this helps.",

        "answer": "Consumed liquid doesn't immediately find its way to the bladder.  \nFirst, it sits around in the stomach until the stomach contents are sufficiently digested, where the mixture is passed to the intestines. Most of the water is absorbed into the blood stream in the large intestine.  \nOnce in the blood, the excess water is removed by the kidneys and then passed down to the bladder.\n\nAll of these processes take time, and the bladder gradually fills until you feel the urge to urinate.",

        "answer": "There is a lot of overlap between the two...many people who follow one also follow the other.\n\nSecularism is about separating religion and government.  Governments should not support or endorse any particular religion, nor should it make decisions based on religious values.  Secularism doesn't reject religion outright, but considers it a personal matter that has no place in government.\n\nHumanism is a broader set of ideals, and different people have different definitions as to what it is.  It focuses on doing what is best for humanity as a whole, as opposed to governments or religious institutions.  There are many different flavors of humanism...most, but not all take a secular approach.",

When a company pays someone 250K$ and still has to pay for air time, billboards and what not, I honestly don't see how it's profitable. Is the amount of people that actually go and buy at that particular shop because of said commerical really make up for the money the company spent?\n\nThanks ahead!",
        "answer": "The short answer is yes, if the company is successful, they'll usually be making that money back and then some.  Like anything else, it's an investment, and the company is hoping that the star power is paying off.\n\nHere's an example that comes to mind: you know those M & M commercials, with the big talking M & M's?  If you're reading this and remember that commercial, then it did its job.  You remember those characters, possibly months or years after seeing one of those ads, and you remember the brand.\n\nThose M & M's are played by Billy West, who is one of the highest paid voice actors working today (among other parts, he was Doug, Ren and Stimpy, Bugs Bunny, and Phillip J. Fry), and by J.K. Simmons, who just won an Oscar last night.  So they got top-tier talent, and it made for an ad campaign that's run for a decade or so.",
